46 HERODOTUS

they pull up from the fens the papyrus which grows every
year, and the upper parts of it they cut off and turn to other
uses, but that which is left below for about a cubit in length
they eat or sell: and those who desire to have the papyrus at
its very best bake it in an oven heated red-hot, and then
eat it. Some too of these people live on fish alone, which
they dry in the sun after having caught them and taken out
the entrails, and then when they are dry, they use thern for
food.

Fish which swim in shoals are not much produced in the
rivers, but are bred in the lakes, and they do as follows 1-
When there comes upon them the desire to breed, they swim
out in shoals towards the sea; and the males lead the way
shedding forth their milt as they go, while the females,
coming after and swallowing it up, from it become impreg-
nated: and when they have become full ot‘ young in the sea
they swim up back again, each shoal to its own haunts. The
same however no longer lead the way as before, but the lead
comes now to the females, and they leading the way in
shoals do just as the males did, that is to say they shed forth
their eggs by a few grains at a time, and the males coming
after swallow thern up. Now these grains are fish, and from
the grains which survive and are not swallowed‚ the fish
grow which afterwards are bred up. Now those of the fish
which are caught as they swim out towards the sea are found
to be rubbed on the left side of the head, but those which
are caught as they swim up again are rubbed on the right
side. This happens to them because as they swim down to
the sea they keep close to the land on the left side of the
river, and again as they swim up they keep to the same
side, approaching and touehing the bank as much as they
can, for tear doubtless of straying from their course by
reason of the stream. When the Nile begins to swell, the
hollow places οἱ the land and the depressions by the side
ot' the river first begin to fill, as the water soaks through
from the river, and so soon as they become full of water,
at once they are all filled with little fishes ; and whence these
are in all likelihood produced, I think that I perceive. In
the preceding year, when the Nile goes down, the fish first
lay eggs in the mud and then retire with the last of the
