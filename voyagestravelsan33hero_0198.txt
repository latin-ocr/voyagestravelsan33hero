190 SIR FRANCIS DRAKE

“ And as touching means of compassing this purpose, they
would conduct him safely through the woods, by the same
ways by which they fied, that he should not need to enter
their havens with danger, but might come upon their baeks
altogether unlooked for. And though his house were of
stone, so that it could not be burnt ; yet if our Captain would
