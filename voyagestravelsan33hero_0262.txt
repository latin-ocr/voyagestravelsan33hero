254 DRAKE’S FAMOUS VOYAGE

pinnaces and boam, should give some attempt unto the little
{ort standing on the entry of the inner haven, near adjoin-
ing to the town, though to small purpose, for that the place
was strong, and the entry, very narrow, was chained over;
so as there could be nothing gotten by the attempt more than
the giving of them an alarm on that other side of the haven,
being a mile and a-half from the place we now were at. In
which attempt the Vice-Admiral had the rudder of his skiff
strucken through with a saker⁷ shot, and a little or no harm
received elsewhere.

The troops being now in their march, half-a-mile behither
the town or less, the ground we were on grew to be strait,
and not above fifty paces over, having the main sea on the
one side of it and the harbour—water or inner sea (as you
may term it) on the other side, which in the plot is plainly
shewed. This strait was fortified clean over with a stone
wall and a ditch without it, the said wall being as orderly
built, with flanking in every part, as can be set down. There
was only so much of this strait unwalled as might serve for
the issuing of the horsemen or the passing of carriage in time
of need. But this unwalled part was not without a very
good barricado of wine-butts or pipes, filled with earth, full
and thick as they might stand on end one by another, some
part of thern standing even within the main sea. This place
of strength was furnished with six great pieces‚ demicul-
verins⁸ and sakers, which shot directly in front upon us as
we approached. Now without this wall, upon the inner side
of the strait, they had brought likewise two great galleys
with their prows to the shore, having planted in them
eleven pieces of ordnance, which did beat all cross the
strait, and flanked our coming on. In these two galleys
were planted three or four hundred small shot, and on

the land, in the guard only of this place, three hundred
shot and pikes.

They, in this their full readiness to receive us, spared not
their shot both great and small. But our Lieutenant-
Genera1‚ taking the advantage of the dark (the daylight
as yet not broken out) approached by the lowest ground,
