DISCOVERY OF GUIANA 361

we eould; at least we drank good Spanish wine, whereof
we had a small quantity in bottles, which above all things
they love. 1 conferred with this Toparimaca of the next⁴¹
way to Gaiana, who conducted our galley and boats to his
own port, and carried us from thence some mile and a-half
to his town; where some of our captains garoused⁴² of his
wine till they were reasonable pleasant, for it is very strong
with pepper, and the juice of divers herbs and fruits digested
and purged. They keep it in great earthen pots οἱ ten or
twelve gallons, very clean and sweet, and are themselves at
their meetings and feasts the greatest carousers and drunk·
ards of the world. When we came to his town we found two
caciques, whereof one was a stranger that had been up the
river in trade, and his boats‚ people, and wife encamped at
the port where we anchored; and the other was of that
country, a follower of Toparimaca. They lay each of them
in a cotton hamaca, which we call Brazil beds, and two
women attending them with six cups, and a little ladle to
fill them out of an earthen pitcher of wine; and so they
drank each of them three of those cups at a time one to the
other, and in this sort they drink drunk at their feasts and
meetings.

That cacique that was a stranger had his wife staying at
the port where we anchored, and in all my life I have seldom
seen a better favoured woman. She was of good stature,
with black eyes, fat of body, of an excellent countenance,
her hair almost as long as herself, tied up again in pretty
knots; and it seemed she stood not in that awe of her hus-
band as the rest, for she spake and discoursed, and drank
among the gentlemen and captains, and was very pleasant,
knowing her own comeliness, and taking great pride therein.
Ι have seen a lady in England so like to her, as but for the
difference of colour, I would have sworn might have been
the same.

The seat of this town of Toparimaca was very pleasant,
standing on a little hill, in an excellent prospect, with goodly
gardens a mile compass round about it, and two very fair
and large ponds of excellent fish adjoining. This town is
called Arowocai; the people are οἱ the nation called N epoios,

⁴² Nearest. ⁴² Caroused.
