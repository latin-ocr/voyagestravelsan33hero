dwellings; whence they might become a portion of the
Roman Empire. With them this honour still remains, as
also the memorials of their ancient association with us: for
they are not under the contempt of paying tribute, nor sub-
ject to be squeezed by the sarmers οἱ the revenue. Free
from all impositions and payments, and only set apart for the
purposes of fighting, they are reserved wholly for the wars,
in the same manner as a magazine of weapons and armour.
Under the same degree of homage are the nation of the Mat-
tiacians. For such is the might and greatness of the Roman
People, as to have carried the awe and esteem of their
Empire beyond the Rhine and the ancient boundaries. Thus
the Mattiaeians, living upon the opposite banks‚ enjoy a
settlement and limits of their owng yet in spirit and inclina-
tion are attached to us: in other things resembling the
Batavians, save that as they still breathe their original air,
still possess their primitive soil, they are thence inspired
with superior vigour and keenness. Amongst the people of
Germany I would not reckon those who occupy the lands
which are under decimation, though they be such as dwell be-

vagabond Gauls, and such as poverty rendered daring, that
region was seized as one belonging to no certain possessor:
afterwards it became a skirt of the Empire and part of a
province, upon the enlargement of our bounds and the ex-
tending of our garrisons and frontier.

Beyond these are the Cattans, whose territories begin at the
Hercynian Forest‚ and consist not of such wide and marshy
plains, as those of the other communities contained within
the vast compass of Germany3 but produce ranges of hills,
such as run lofty and contiguous for a long tract, then by
degrees sink and decay. Moreover the Hercynian Forest
attends for a while its native cattam, then suddenly for-
sakes them. This people are distinguished with bodies more
hardy and robust, compact limbs, stern countenanees, and
greater vigour of spirit. For Germanas, they are men of
much sense and address.⁹ They dignify ehosen men, listen
to such as are set over them, know how to preserve their
post, to discern occasions, to rebate their own ardour and
