EGYPT 15

less it is the most mistaken of all: for indeed this way has
no more truth in it than the rest, alleging as it does that
the Nile flows from melting snow; whereas it flows out ot'
Libya through the midst of the Ethiopians, and so comes out
into Egypt. How then should it flow from snow, when it
flows from the hottest parts to those which are cooler? And
indeed most of the facts are such as to convince a man (one
at least who is capable of reasoning about such matters),
that it is not at all likely that it flows from snow. The first
and greatest evidence is afforded by the winds, which blow ’
hot from these regions; the second is that the land is rain-
less always and without frost, whereas after snow has
fallen rain must necessarily come within five days, so that
if it snowed in those parts rain would fall there; the third
evidence is afforded by the people dwelling there, who are
of a black colour by reason of the burning heat. More-
over kites and swallows remain there through the year and
do not leave the land; and cranes flying from the cold
weather which comes on in the region of Scythia come
regularly to these parts for wintering: if then it snowed ever
so little in that land through which the Nile fiows and in
which it has its rise, none of these things would take place,
as necessity compels us to admit. As for him who talked
about the Ocean‚ he carried his tale into the region of the
unknown, and so he need not be refuted; since Ι for my
part know ot* no river Ocean existing, but I think that
Homer or one of the poets who were before him invented
the name and introduced it into his verse.

If however after I have found fault with the opinions
proposed, I am bound to declare an opinion of my own
about the matters which are in doubt, Ι will tell what to
my mind is the reason why the Nile increases in the sum-
mer. In the winter season the Sun, being driven away
from his former path through the heaven by the stormy
winds, comes to the upper parts of Libya. If one would
set forth the matter in the shortest way, all has now been
said; for whatever region this god approaches most and
stands directly above, this it may reasonably be supposed
is most in want of water, and its native streams of rivers
are dried up most. However, to set it forth at greater
