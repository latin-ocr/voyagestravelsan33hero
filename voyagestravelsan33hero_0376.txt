368 SIR WALTER RALEIGH

and in the meantime provide for us the best he could, of
all that his country yielded. The same night he returned to
Orocotona‚ his own town; so as he went that day eight-
and-twenty miles, the weather being very hot, the country
being situate between four and five degrees of the equi-
noctial. This Topiawari is held for the proudest and wisest
of all the Orenoqueponi, and so he behaved himself towards
me in all his answers, at my return, as Ι marvelled to find
a man of that gravity and judgment and of so good discourse,

the nations upon the river of our being there, and that we
desired to 500 the lords of Canztria, which dwelt within
the province upon that river, making them know that we
