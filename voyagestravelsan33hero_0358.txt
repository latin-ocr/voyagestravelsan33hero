350 SIR WALTER RALEIGH

’ the river, or length of the breach. But this it chanced‚ that
entering into a river (which because it had no name, we
called the River of the Red Cross, ourselves being the first
Christians that ever came therein), the 22. of May, as we
were rowing up the same, we espied a small canoa with three
Indiam, which by the swiftness of my barge‚ rowing with
eight oars‚ I overtook yere they could cross the river. The
rest of the people on the banks‚ shadowed under the thick
wood‚ gazed on with a doubtful conceit what might befall
those three which we had taken. But when they perceived
that we offered them no violence, neither entered their canoa
with any of ours, nor took out of the canoa any of theirs,
they then began to show themselves on the bank’s side, and

As we abode here awhile‚ our Indian pilot, called Ferdi-

barge‚ crying out that his brother was slain. With that we
set hands on one of them that was next us, a very old man,
and brought him into the barge‚ assuring him that if we
had not our pilot again we would presently cut off his head.
This old man, being resolved that he should pay the loss of
the other, cried out to those in the woods to save Ferdi-
nando, our pilot ; but they followed him notwithstanding,
and hunted after him upon the foot with their deer-dogs, and
with so main a cry that all the woods echoed with the shout
they made. But at the last this poor chased Indian recovered
