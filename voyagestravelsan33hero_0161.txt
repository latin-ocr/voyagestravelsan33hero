THIRD VOYAGE 153

never recovor her: but first all the pinnaces should be
brought aboard her, that every one might take out of her
whatever they laeked or liked.

This, though the company at the first marvelled at; yet ⁴
presently it was put in execution and performed that night.

Our Captain had his desire, and men enough for his
pinnaces.

The next morning (16th August) we resolved to seek out
some fit place, in the Sound of Darien, where we might
safely leave our ship at anchor, not discoverable by the
enemy, who thereby might imagine us quite departed from
the coast, and we the meantime better follow our purposes
with our pinnaces; of which our Captain would himself

to rid a large plot of ground, both of trees and makes,
and to build us houses sufficient for all our lodging, and
one especially for all our public meetings; wherein the
Negro which fled to us before, did us great service, as being
well acquainted with the country, and their means of build-
ing. Our archers made themselves butts to shoot at, be-
cause we had many that delighted in that exercise, and
wanted not a fletcher to keep our bows and arrows in order.
The rest of the company, every one as he liked best, made
his disport at bowls, quoits, keiles, &c. For our Captain
allowed one half of the company to pass their time thus,
