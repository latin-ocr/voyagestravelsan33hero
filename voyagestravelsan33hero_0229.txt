ROUND THE WORLD 221

to write his letter to the town to command all the townsmen
to avoid, that we might safely water there. Which being
done, and they departed, we ransacked the town; and in one
house we found a pot, of the quantity of a bushel‚ full of
reals of plate‚ whichwe brought to our ship. And here one
Thomas Moon, one of our company, took a Spanish gentle-
man asv he was flying out of the town; and, searching him,
he found a chain of gold about him, and other jewels, which ·
he took, and so let him go. At this place our General,
among other Spaniards, set ashore his Portugal pilot which
he took at the islands of Cape Verde out of a ship of St.
Mary port, of Portugal. And having set them ashore we
departed hence, and sailed to the island of Canum· where
our Genera] landed, and brought to shore his own ship‚ and
discharged her, mended and graved her, and furnished our
ship with water and wood sufficiently.

And while we were here we espied a ship and set sail
after her, and took her, and found in her two pilots and a
Spanish governor, going for the islands of the Philip-
pinas. We searched the ship, and took some of her mer-
chandises, and so let her go. Our General at this place and
time, thinking himself, both in respect of his private injuries
received from the Spaniards, as also of their contempts and
indignities offered to our country and prince in general,
sufficiently satisfied and revenged; and supposing that her
Majesty at his return would rest contented with this service,
purposed to continue no longer upon the Spanish coast, but
began to consider and to consult of the best way for his
country.

He thought it not good to return by the Straits, for two
special causes ; the one, lest the Spaniards should there wait
and attend for him in great number and strength, whose
hands, he, being left but one ship, could not possibly escape.
The other cause was the dangerous situation of the mouth
of the Straits in the South Sea ; where continual storms
reigning and blustering, as he found by experience, besides
the shoals and sands upon the coast, he thought it not a good
course to adventure that way. He resolved, therefore, to
avoid these hazards, to go forward to the Islands of the
Malucos, and therehence. ἑο sail the course of the Portugals
