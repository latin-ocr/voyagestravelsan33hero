EGYPT Sl

certain portion of his army and leit the men there as settlers
in the land, or whether some of his soldiers were wearied
by his distant marches and remained by the river Phasis.
For the people of Colchis are evidently Egyptian, and this Ι
perceived for myselt‘ before Ι heard it from others. So when
I had come to consider the matter I asked them both; and
the Colchians had remembrance of the Egyptians more than
the Egyptians of the Colchians; but the Egyptians said they
believed that the Colchians were a portion of the army of
Sesostris. That this was so I conjectured myself not only
because they are dark-skinned and have curly hair (this of
itself amounts to nothing, for there are other races which
are so), but also still more because the Colchians, Egyptians,
and Ethiopians alone of all the races of men have practised
circumcision from the first. The Phenicians and the Syrians
who dwell in Palestine confess themselves that they have
learnt it from the Egyptians, and the Syrians about the river
Thermodon and the river Parthenios, and the Macronims,
who are their neighbours, say that they have learnt it lately
from the Colchians. These are the only taces of men who
practise circumcision‚ and these evidently practise it in the
same manner as the Egyptians. Of the Egyptians themselves
however and the Ethiopians, Ι am not able to say which
learnt from the other, for undoubtedly it is a most ancient
custom; but that the other nations learnt it by intercourse
with the EgyptianS, this among others is to me a strong
proof, namely that those of the Phenicians who have inter-
course with Hellas cease to follow the example of the
Egyptians in this matter, and do not circumcise their chil-
dren. Now let me tell another thing about the Colchians to
show how they resemble the Egyptians :—they alone work
flax in the same fashion as the Egyptians, and the two
nations are like one another in their whole manner of living
and also in their language: now the linen of Colchis is
called by the Hellenes Sardonic, whereas that from Egypt
is called Egyptian. The pillars which Sesostris king of
Egypt set up in the various countries are for the most part
no longer to be seen extant; but in Syria Palestine I myself
saw them existing with the inscription upon them which
Ι have mentioned and the emblem. Moreover in Ionia there
