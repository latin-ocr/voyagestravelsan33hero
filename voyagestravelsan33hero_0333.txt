DISCOVERY OF GUIANA 325

wasted with torments. These are called in their own lan-
guage acarewana‚ and now of late since English, French‚
and Spanish, are come among them, they call themselves
captains, because they perceive that the ch'iefest of every
ship is called by that name. Those five captains in the chain
were called Wannawanare, Carroaori, Maquarima, Tarroo-
panama, and Aterima. So as both to be revenged of the
former wrong, as also considering that to enter Gaiana by
small boats, to depart 400 or 500 miles from my ships, and

We then hasted away towards our purposed discovery,
and first Ι called all the captains of the island together that
were enemies to the Spaniards; for there were some which
Berreo had brought out of other countries, and planted there
to eat out and waste those that were natural of the place..
And by my Indian interpreter, which Ι carried out of Eng-
Zand, Ι made them understand that Ι was the servant of a
queen who was the great cacique of the north, and a virgin,
and had more caciqui under her than there were trees in
that island; that she was an enemy to the Castellani in re-
spect of their tyranny and oppression, and that she delivered
all such nations about her, as were by them oppressed; and
