10 HERODOTUS

out through it into the open sea, would spend forty days
upon the voyage, using oars; and with respect to breadth,
where the gulf is broadest it is half a day's sail across: and
there is in it an ebb and flow of tide every day. Just such
another guli I suppose that Egypt was, and that the one ran
in towards Ethiopia from the Northern Sea, and the other,
the Arabian, of which I am about to speak, tended from the
South towards Syria, the gulfs boring in so as almost to
meet at their extreme points, and passing by one another
with but a small space left between. Is then the stream of
the Nile should turn aside into this Arabian gulf, what would
hinder that gulf from being filled up with silt as the river
continued to flow, at all events within a period of twenty
thousand years? indeed for my part I am of opinion that it
would be filled up even within ten thousand years. How,
then, in all the time that has elapsed before I came into
being should not a gulf be filled up even of much greater
² size than this by a river so great and so active? As regards
Egypt then, Ι both believe those who say that things are so,
and for myself also I am strongly of opinion that they are

so3 because 1 have observed that Egypt runs out into the ,

sea further than the adjoining land, and that shells are
found upon the mountains of it, and an efflorescence of salt
forms upon the surface, so that even the pyramids are being
eaten away by it, and moreover that of all the mountains of
Egypt, the range which lies above Memphis is the only one
which has sand: besides which I notice that Egypt resembles
neither the land of Arabia, which borders upon it, nor
Libya, nor yet Syria (for they are Syrians who dwell in
the parts of Arabia lying along the sea), but that it has soil
which is black and easily breaks up, seeing that it is in
truth mud and silt brought down from Ethiopia by the
river: but the soil of Libya, we know, is reddish in colour
and rather sandy, while that of Arabia and Syria is some-
what clayey and rocky. The priests also gave me a strong
proof concerning this land as follows, namely that in the
reign of king Mon-is, whenever the river reached a height
of at least eight cubits it watered Egypt below Memphis:
and not yet nine hundred years had gone by since the death
of Moiris, when Ι heard these things from the priests: now
