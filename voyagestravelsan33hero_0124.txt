116 TACITUS

Cheruscans; a people who finding no enemy to rouse them.
were enfeebled by a peace over lasting and uniform‚ but
such as they sailed not to nourish. A conduct which proved
more pleasing than secure; since treacherous is that repose
which you enjoy amongst neighbours that are very powerful
and very fond of rule and mastership. When recourse is
once had to the sword, modesty and fair dealing will be
vainly pleaded by the weaker; names these which are always
assumed by the stronger. Thus the Cheruscans‚ they who
formerly bore the character of good and upright, are now
called (towards and fools,· and the fortune of the Cattans
who subdued them, grew immediately to be wisdom. In the
ruin of the Cheruseans, the Fosians, also their neighbours,
were involved; and in their calamities bore an equal share,
though in their prosperity they had been weaker and less

In the same winding tract of Germany live the Cimbrians,
close to the ocean; a community now very small, but great
in fame. Nay, of their ancient renown, many and extensive
are the traces and monuments still remaining ; even their
entrenchments upon either shore, so vast in compass that
from thence you may even now measure the greatness and

Metellus and Papirius Carbo. If from that time we count
to the second Consulship of the Emperor Trajan, the in-
terval comprehends near two hundred and ten years; so
long have we been conquering Germany. In a course of
time, so vast between these two periods, many have been
the blows and disasters suffered on each side. In truth
neither from the Samnites, nor from the Carfflaginians, nor
from both Spains, nor from all the nations of Gaul, have
we received more frequent checks and alarms; nor even
from the Parthians: for, more vigorous and invincible is
the liberty of the Germans than the monarchy of the Arsa-
cides. Indeed‚ what has the power of the East to allege to
our dishonour; but the fall of Crassus, that power which
was itself overthrown and abased by Ventidius, with the
