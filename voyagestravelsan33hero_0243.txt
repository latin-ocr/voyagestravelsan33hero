ROUND THE WORLD 235

burnt the town, crossed the Atlantic in eighteen days, and arrived
at Dominica. At daybreak, on New Year’s Day, 1586, Drake’s
soldiers lauded in Espafiola, a few miles to the west of the capital,
and before evening Carlile and Powell had entered the city, which
the colonists only saved from destruction by the payment of a
heavy ransom. Drake's plan was to do exactly the same at
Carthagena and Nombre de Dios, and thence to strike across the
isthmus and secure the treasure that lay waiting for transport at
Panama. Drake held St. Domingo for a month, and Carthagena
for six weeks. He was compelled to forego the further prosecu-
tion of his enterprise. A deadly fever, which had attacked the
men during the sojourn at Santiago, still continued its ravages.
In existing circumstances, even had Nombre de Dios been suc-
cessfully attacked‚ the march to Panama was out of the questi0n3
and after consultation with the military commanders, Drake re-
solved on sailing home at once by way of Florida. He brought
back with him all the colonists who had been left by Sir Richard
Greenville in ‘ Virginia.’ Drake had offered either to furnish them
with stores, and to leave thern a ship, or to take them home. The
former offer was accepted: but a furious storm which ensued
caused them to change their minds. They recognized in it the
hand of God, whose will it evidently was that they should no
longer be sojourners in the American wilderness; and the first
English settlement of ‘Virginia' was abandoned accordingly.

Ten years afterwards (1595) Drake was again at the head of
a similar expedition. The second command was given to his old
associate Hawkins, Frobisher, his Vice-Admiral in 1585, having
recently died of the wound received at Crozon. This time
Nombre de Dios was taken and burnt, and 750 soldiers set out
under Sir Thomas Baskerville to march to Panama: but at the
first of the three forts which the Spaniards had by this time con-
structed, the march had to be abandoned. Drake did not long
survive this second failure of his favourite scheme. He was at-
tacked by dysentery a fortnight afterwards, and in a month he
died. When he felt the hand of death upon him, he rose, dressed
. himself, and endeavoured to make a fat-ewell speech to those
around him. Exhausted by the effort, he was lifted to his berth,
and within an hour breathed his last. Hawkins had died off
Puerto Rico six weeks previously.
