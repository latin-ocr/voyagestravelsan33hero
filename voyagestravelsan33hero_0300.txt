292 GILBERT’S VOYAGE

pensed with by the commodity of stoves, warrn clothing‚
meats and drinks: all of which need not to be wanting in
the N ewfoundland, if we had intent there to inhabit.

In the south parts we found no inhabitants, which by all
likelihood have abandoned those coasts, the same being so
much frequented by Christians; but in the north are savages
altogether harmless. Touching the commodities of this
country, serving either for sustentation of inhabitants or for
maintenance of traffic‚ there are and may be made divers;
so that it seemeth that nature hath recompensed that only
defect and incommodity of some sharp cold‚ by many bene-
fits; namely‚ with incredible quantity, and no less variety, of
kinds of fish in the sea and fresh waters, as trouts, salmom,
and other fish to us unknown; also cod, which alone draweth
many nations thither, and is become the most famous fishing
of the world3 abundance of whales‚ for which also is a very
great trade in the bays of Placentia and the Grand Bay,

in them as plentifully, by time and industry; namely‚ resin,
piteh, tar, soap-ashes, deal-board‚ masts for ships, hides, furs,
flax, hemp, corn, cables, cordage, linen eloth, metals, and
many more. All which the countries will afford, and the soil
is apt to yield. The trees for the most in those south parts
are fir—trees, pine, and cypress, all yielding gum and turpen-
tine. Cherry trees bearing fruit no bigger than a small pease.
Also pear-trees‚ but fruitless. Other trees of some sort to
us unknown. The soil along the coast is not deep of earth,
bringing forth abundantly peasen small, yet good feeding for
cattle. Roses passing sweet, like unto our musk roses in
form; raspises; a berry which we call whorts, good and
