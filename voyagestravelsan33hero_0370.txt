³62 SIR WALTER RALEIGH

and are followers of Cara-pana. In that place I saw very
aged people, that we might perceive all their sinews and
veins without any flesh, and but even as a case covered only
with skin. The lord of this place gave me an old man for
pilot, who was of great experience and travel, and knew the
river most perfectly both by day and night. And it shall be
requisite for any man that passeth it to have such a pilot;
for it is four, five, and six miles over in many places, and
twenty miles in other places, with wonderful eddies ancl
strong eux-rents, many great islands, and divers shoals‚ and
many dangerous rocks; and besides upon any increase of
wind so great a billow, as we were sometimes in great peril
of drowning in the galley, for the small boats durst not come
from the shore but when it was very fair.

The next day we hasted thence, and having an easterly
wind to help us, we spared our arms from rowing3 for after
we entered Orenoque, the river lieth for the most part east
and west, even from the sea unto Quito, in Peru. This river
is navigable with barks little less than 1000 miles; and from
the place where we entered it may be sailed up in small pin-
naces to many of the best parts of Nuevo Reyno de Granada
and of Popayan. And from no place may the cities of these
parts of the Indies be so easily taken and invaded as from
hence.43 All that day we sailed up a braneh of that river,
having on the left hand a great island, which they call Assa-
pcma, which may contain some five—and—twenty miles in
length, and six miles in breadth‚ the great body of the river
running on the other side of this island. Beyond that middle
braneh there is also another island in the river, called swano,
which is twice as big as the Isle of Wight; and beyond it,
and between it and the main of Gaiana, runneth a third
braneh of Orenoque, called Arraroopana. All three are
goodly branches, and all navigable for great ships. I judge
the river in this place to be at least thirty miles broad,
reckoning the islands which divide the branches in it, for
afterwards I sought also both the other branches.

After we reached to the head of the island called Assapana,
a little to the westward on the right hand there opened a

conquest of New Granada and Peru (see pp. 374-375.)
