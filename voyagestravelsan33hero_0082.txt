74 “ HERODOTUS

means in the tongue of Hellas “ honourable and good man.”
From their declaration then it followed, that they of whom
the images were had been of form like this, and far removed
from being gods: but in the time before these men they
said that gods were the rulers in Egypt, not mingling with
rnen, and that of these always one had power at a time; and
the last of thern who was king over Egypt was Oros the son
of Osiris, whom the Hellenes call Apollo: he was king over
Egypt last, having deposed Typhon. Now Osiris in the
tongue of Hellas is Dionysos.

Among the Hellenes Heracles and Dionysos and Pan are
accounted the latest—born of the gods; but with the Egyp-
tians Pan is a very ancient god, and he is one of those which
are called the eight go'ds, while Heracles is of the second
rank, who are called the twelve gods, and Dionysos is of the
third rank, namely of those who were born of the twelve
gods. Now as to Heracles I have shown already how many
years old he is according to the Egyptians themselves, reck-

existed for yet more years than these, and Dionysos for the
smallest number of years as compared with the others; and
even for this last they reckon down to the reign of Amasis
fifteen thousand years. This the Egyptians say that they
know for a certainty, since they always kept a reckoning
and wrote down the years as they came. Now the Dionysos
who is said to have been born of Semele the daughter of
Cadmos‚ was born about sixteen hundred years before my
time, and Heracles who was the son of Alcmene, about nine
hundred years, and that Pan who was born of Penelope, for
of her and of Hermes Pan is said by the Hellenes to have
been born, came into being later than the wars of Troy,
about eight hundred years before my time. Of these two
accounts every man may adopt that one which he shall find
the more credible when he hears it. Ι however, for my part,
have already declared my opinion about them. For if these
also, like Heracles the son of Amphitryon, had appeared be-
fore all men’s eyes and had lived their lives to old age in
Hellas, Ι mean Dionysos the son of Semele and Pan the son
of Penelope, then one would have said that these also had
been born mere men, having the names of those gods who
