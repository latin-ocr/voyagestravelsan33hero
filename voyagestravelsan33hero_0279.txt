SIR HUMPHREY GILBERT'S
VOYAGE To NEWFOUNDLAND

A REPORT os the VOYAGE and success thereos, attempted in the year of
our Lord 1583, by Sta HUMFREY GILBERT, Kmowr, witlz other
gentlemen assistz‘ng him in tlzat action, intended to discover and to
plant Christian inhabitants in place convenient, upon those large
and ample countries extended northward from the Cape of FLORmA,
lying under very temperate climes, esteemed fertile and rich in
minerals. yet not in the actual possession of any Christian prince-
Written by MR. EDWARD HAYES, gentleman, anci principal actor in
the same voyagel, wlzo alone continued unto the end, and, by God’s
special assistance, returned home with his retinue sa fe and entire.

ANY voyages have been pretended‚ yet hitherto
M never any thoroughly accomplished by our nation,

γ of exact discovery into the bowels of those main,
ample, and vast countries extended infinitely into the north
from thirty degrees‚ or rather from twenty-five degrees, of
septentrional latitude‚ neither hath a right way been taken of
planting a Christian habitation and regiment² upon the
same, as well may appear both by the little we yet do actually
possess therein, and by our ignorance of the riches and
secrets within those kinds, which unto this day we know
chiefly by the travel and report of other nations, and most
of the French, who albeit they cannot challenge such right
and interest unto the said countries as we, neither these
many years have had opportunity nor means so great to dis-
cover and to plant, being vexed with the calamities of in-
testine wars, as we have had by the inestimable benefit of our
long and happy peace, yet have they both ways performed

²Hayes was captain and owner of the Golden Hind, Gilbert's Reat-
Admiral. ² Govern ment.
