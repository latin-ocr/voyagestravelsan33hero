DISCOVERY OF GUIANA 355

Trinidad, and also those that remained with Campana in
Emeria, were joined together in some village upon that
river. But when it grew towards night, and we demanded
where the place waS, he told us but four reaches more.
When we had rowed four and four, we saw no sign; and
our poor watermen, even heart—broken and tired, were
ready to give up the ghost; for we had now corne from
the galley near forty miles.

At the last we determined to hang the pilot; and if we
had well known the way back again by night, he had
surely gone. But our own necessities pleaded sufficiently
for his safety; for it was as dark as pitch, and the river
began so to narrow itself, and the trees to hang over
from side to side, as we were driven with arming swords
to cut a passage thorough those branches that covered
the water. We were very desirous to find this town hop-
ing of a feast, because we made but a short breakfast aboard
the galley in the morning, and it was now eight o’clock
at night, and our stomachs began to gnaw apace; but
whether it was best to return or go on, we began to doubt,
suspecting treason in the pilot more and more ; but the
poor old Indian ever assured us that it was but a little
further, but this one turning and that turning; and at the
last about one o’clock after midnight we saw a light, and
rowing towards it we heard the dogs of the village. When
we lauded we found few people; for the lord of that place
was gone with divers canoas above 400 miles off, upon
a journey towards the head of Orenoque, to trade for gold,
and to buy women of the Cannibals, who afterwards unfor-
tunately passed by us as we rode at an anchor in the port
of Morequito in the dark of the night, and yet carne so
near us as his canoas grated against our barges; he left
one of his company at the port of Morequito, by whom we
understood that he had brought thirty young women, divers
plates of gold, and had great store of fine pieces of cotton
eloth, and cotton beds. In his house we had good store
of bread, fish, hens, and Indian drink, and so rested that
night; and in the morning, after we had traded with such
of his people as came down, we returned towards our galley,
and brought with us some quantity of bread, fish, and hens.
