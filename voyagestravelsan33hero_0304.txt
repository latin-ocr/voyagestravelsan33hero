296 GILBERT’S VOYAGE

dry, sweet oils‚ besides many other, as marmahdes, figs,
limons barrelled‚ and such like. Also we had other neces-
sary provisions for trimming our ships, nets and lines to fish
withal, boats or pinnaces fit for discovery. In brief, we were
supplied of our wants commodiously‚ as if we had been in
a country or some city populous and plentiful of all things·

We departed from this harbour of S t. solm’s upon Tues-
day, the 20. of August, which we found by exact observation
to be in 47 degrees 40 minutes; and the next day by night we
were at Cape Race, 25 leagues from the same harborough.
This cape lieth south—south-west from St. J olm’s; it is a low
land, being off from the cape about half a league ; within the
sea riseth up a rock against the point of the cape, which
thereby is easily known. It is in latitude 46 degrees 25
minutes. Under this cape we were becalmed a small time,
during which we laid out hooks and lines to take cod, and
drew in less than two hours fish so large and in such abun-
dance, that many days after we fed upon no other provision.
From hence we shaped our course unto the island of Sablon,
if conveniently it would so fall out, also directly to Cape
Breton.

Sablon lieth to the seaward of Cape Breton about 25
leagues, whither we were determined to go upon intelligence
we had of a Portugal, during our abode in St. John’s, who
was himself present when the Portugals, above thirty years
past, did put into the same island both neat and swine to
breed, which were since exceedingly multiplied. This seemed
unto us very happy tidings‚ to have in an island lying so near
unto the main, which we intended to plant upon, such store
of cattle, whereby we might at all times conveniently be re·
lieved of victual‚ and served of store for breed.

In this course we trended along the coast, which from
Cape Race stretcheth into the north-west, making a bay which
some called Trepassa? Then it goeth out again towards the
west, and maketh a point, which with Cape Καί-ε lieth in
manner east and west. But this point inclineth to the north,
to the west of which goeth in the Ray of Placentia. We sent
men on land to take view of the soil along this coast, whereof

which Cape Race itself is named.
