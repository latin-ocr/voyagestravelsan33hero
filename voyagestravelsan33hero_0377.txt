DISCOVERY OF GUIANA 359

this cacique therewith, and how Ι was sent by her Majesty
for the purpose aforesaid, and gathered also what I could
of him touching the estate of Gaiana. And I found that
those also of Caroli were not only enemies to the Spaniards,
but most of all to the Epnremei, which abound in gold.
And by this Wanuretona Ι had knowledge that on the
head of this river were three mighty nations‚ which were
seated on a great lake, from whence this river descended,
and were called Cassipagotos, Eparegotos‚ and Arausa-
gotos,·⁴⁵ and that all those either against the Spaniards or
the Epuremei would join with us, and that if we entered
the land over the mountains of Curaa we should satisfy
ourselves with gold and all other good things. He told us
farther of a nation called Iwarawaqueri, before spoken of,
that held daily war with the Epitremei that inhabited
Macureguarai, the first civil town of Gaiana, of the subjects
of Iuga, the emperor.

Upon this river one Captain George, that Ι took with
Berreo, told me that there was a great silver mine, and that
it was near the banks of the said river. But by this time
as well Orenoque, Caroli, as all the rest of the rivers were
risen four or five feet in height, so as it was not possible
by the strength of any men, or with any boat whatsoever,
to row into the river against the stream. I therefore sent
Captain Tlr'n, Captain Gremzvile, my nephew, John Gilbert,
my cousin Butslzead Gorges, Captain Clarke, and some
thirty shot more to coast the river by land, and to go to a
town some twenty miles over the valley called Amnatapoi;
and they found guides there to go farther towards the
mountain foot to another great town called Capzzrepana,
belonging to a cacique called Haharacoa, that was a nephew
to old Topiawari, king of Ammaia, our chiefest friend, be-
cause this town and province of Capurepana adjoined to
Macureguarai‚ which was a frontier town of the empire.
And the meanwhile myself with Captain Gifford‚ Captain
Caulfield, Edward Hancock, and some half—a-dozen shot
marched overland to view the strange overfalls of the river
of Caroli, which roared so far off ; and also to see the

1⁵The Purigotos and Arinagotos are still settled on the upper tributaries
of the Caroni river. No such lake as that mentioned is known to exist.
