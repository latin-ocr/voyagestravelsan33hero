ROUN D THE WORLD 243

01 the way as is aforesaid. Now by the time we were thus
ranged into a very brave order, daylight began to appear.
And being advanced hard to the wall, we saw no enemy to
resist. Whereupon the Lieutenant-General appointed Cap-
tain Sampson with thirty shot‚⁶ and Captain Barton with
other thirty, to go down into the town, which stood in the
valley under us, and might very plainly be viewed all over
from that place where the whole army was now arrived;
and presently after these captains was sent the great ensign‚
which had nothing in it but the plain English crOSS‚ to be
placed towards the sea, that our fleet might see S t. George’s
cross flourish in the enemy’s forti-ess. Order was given that
all the ordnance throughout the town and upon all the plat-
forms, which were about fifty pieces all ready charged,
should be shot off in honour of the Queen’s Majesty’s corona-
tion day, being the 17. of November, after the yearly custom
of England, which was so answered again by the ordnance
out of all the ships in the ficet, which now was come near,

still the most part of his force on the hillt0p‚ till such time
as the town was quartered out for the lodging of the whole
army. Which being done, every captain took his own quar-
ter; and in the evening was placed such a sufficient guard
upon every part of the town that we had no cause to fear
any present enemy. Thus we continued in the city the space
of fourteen days, taking such spoils as the place yielded,
which were, for the most part, wine, oil, meaI, and some
other such like things for victual as vinegar, olives, and some
other trash‚ as merchandise for their Indian trades. But
there was not found any treasure at all, or anything else of
worth besides.

The situation of Santiago is somewhat strange3 in form
like a triangle, having on the east and west sides two moun-
tains of rock and cliff, as it were hanging over it; upon the
top of which two mountains were builded certain fortifica-
tions to preserve the town from any harrn that might be
offered, as in a plot is plainly shewed. From thence on the
south side of the town is the main sea; and on the north side,
