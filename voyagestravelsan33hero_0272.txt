264 DRAKE'S FAMOUS VOYAGE

on his fise the tune of the Prince of Orange his song. And
being called unto by the guard, he told thern before he
put foot out of the boat what he was himself, and how the
Spaniards were gone from the fort; offering either to re-
main in hands there, or else to return to the place with them
that would go.

Upon this intelligence the General, the Lieutenant-Gen-
eral, with some of the captains in one skiff and the Vice-
Admiral with some others in his skiff, and two or three
pinnaces furnished of soldiers with them, put presently over

two pieces of ordnance at us; but on shore we went, and
entered the place without finding any man there.

When the day appeared, we found it built all of timber,

the day opened, we assayed to go to the town, but could not
by reason of some rivers and broken ground which was be-
tween the two places. And therefore being enforced to
embark again into our pinnaces, we went thither upon the
great main river, which is called, as also the town, by the
name of St. Augustine. At our approaching to land, there
were some that began to shew themselves, and to bestow
some few shot upon us, but presently withdrew themselves,
