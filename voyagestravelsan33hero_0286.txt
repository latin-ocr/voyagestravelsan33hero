278 GILBERT’S VOYAGE

as we had, before our store yet remaining, but chiefly the
time and season of the year, were too far spent. Neverthe-
less, it seemed first very doubtful by what way to shape our
course, and to begin our intended discovery, either from the
south northward or from the north southward. The first,
that is, beginning south, without all controversy was the
likeliest; wherein we were assured to have commodity of the
current which from the Cape of Florida setteth northward,
and would have surthered greatly our navigation, discover-
ing from the foresaid cape along towards Cape Breton, and
all those lands lying to the north. Also‚ the year being far
spent, and arrived to the month of June, we were not to
spend time in northerly courses, where we should be sur-
prised with timely winter, but to covet the south, which We
had space enough then to have attained‚ and there might
with less detriment have wintered that season, being more
mild and short in the south than in the north, where winter
is both long and rigorous. These and other like reasons
alleged in favour of the southern course first to be taken, to
the contrary was inferred that forasmuch as both our vic-
tuals and many other needful provisions were diminished
and left insufficient for so long a voyage and for the win-
tering of so many men, we ought to shape a course most
likely to minister supply3 and that was to take the New-
foundland in our way, which was but 700 leagues from our
English coast. Where being usually at that time of the
year, and until the fine of August, a multitude of ships re-
pairing thither for fish, we should be relieved abundantly
with many necessaries, which, after the fishing ended, they
might well spare and freely impart unto us. Not staying
long upon that Newland coast, we might proceed southward,
and follow still the sun, until we arrived at places more

temperate to our content.
By which reasons we were the rather induced to follow

this northerly course, obeying unto necessity, which must
be supplied. Otherwise, we doubted that sudden approach
of winter, bringing with it continual fog and thick mists,
tempest and rage of weather, also contrariety of currents
descending from the Cape of Florida unto Cape Breton and
Cape Race, would fall out to be great and irresistible irn-
