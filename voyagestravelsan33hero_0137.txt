TO THE HIGH AND MIGHTY

CHARLES THE FIRST, oF

GREAT BRITAIN‚FRANCE,and IRELAND,
KING, all the blessings of this, and a better life.

Mos‘r GRACIOUS SOVEREIGN,

ΤΗΑΤ this brief Treatise is yonrs, both by right and by suc-
cession, will appear by the Author’s and Actor's ensuing Dedica-
tion. To praise either the Mistress or the Servant, might justly
incur the censure of Quis eos unquam sanus vituperavit; either’s
worth having sufficiently blazed their farne.

This Present loseth nothing, by glancing on former actions;
and the observation of passed adventures may probably advan-
tage future employments. CAESAR wrote his own Commentaries;
and this Doer was partly the Inditor.

Neither is there wanting living testimony to confirm its truth.

For his sake, then, cherish what is good! and Ι shall will-
ingly entertain check for what is amiss. Your favourable accept-
ance may encourage my collecting of more neglected notes!
However, though Virtue, as Lands, be not inheritable; yet hath
he left of his Name, one that resolves, and therein joys to
approve himself.

Your most humble and loyal subject,

Famem DRAKE [Bart.]
