of us; yet we then keeping much to the north, until we had
got into the height and elevation of England, we met with
very foul weather and terrible seas‚ breaking short and high,
pyramid-wise. The reason whereof seemed to proceed either
of hilly grounds high and low within the sea, as we see
hills and vales upon the land, upon which the seas do mount
and fall, or else the cause proceedeth of diversity of winds,
shifting often in sundry points, all which having power to
move the great ocean, which again is not presently settled,
5ο many seas do encounter together, as there had been di-
versity of winds. Howsoever it cometh to pass, men which
all their lifetime had occupied the sea never saw more out-

Hind, suddenly her lights were out, whereof as it were in
a moment we lost the sight, and withal our watch cried
the General was cast away, which was too true. For in that
moment the frigate was devoured and swallowed up of
the sea. Yet still we looked out all that night, and ever
after until we arrived upon the coast of England; omitting
no small sail at sea, unto which we gave not the tokens be-
tween us agreed upon to have perfect knowledge of each
other, if we should at any time be separated.

In great torment of weather and peril of drowning it
pleased God to send safe home the Golden Hind, which
arrived in Falmouth the 22. of September, being Sunday,
not without as great danger escaped in a flaw coming from
the south-east, with such thick mist that we could not discern
