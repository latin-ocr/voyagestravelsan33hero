THIRD VOYAGE 153

nance; but indeed to draw us on to land confidently, and to
presume of our strength. Oui· Captain commanding the
grapnell to be cast out of the stem, veered the pinnace
ashore, and as soon as she touched the sand, he alone leapt
ashore in their sight, to declare that he durst set his foot a

The next morning (22nd October) the wind, which had
been westerly in the evening‚ altered to the Eastward.

About the dawning of the day, we espied two sails turning
towards ue, whereupon our Captain weighed with his pin-
naces, leaving the two frigates unmanned. But when we
were come somewhat nigh thern, the wind calmed, and we
