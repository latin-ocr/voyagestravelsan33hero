20 HERODOTUS

men had devised various other extravagant *things and
also they had told off by lot five of themselves to go to
see the desert parts of Libya and to try whether they could
discover more than those who had previously explored fur-
thest: for in those parts of Libya which are by the
Northern Sea, beginning from Egypt and going as far as
the headland of Soloeis, which is the extreme point of
Libya, Libyans (and of them many races) extend along
the whole coast, except so much as the Hellenes and
Phenicians hold3 but in the upper parts, which lie above the
sea-coast and above those people whose land comes down
to the sea, Libya is full of wild beasts; and in the parts above
the land of wild beasts it is full of sand‚ terribly waterless
and utterly desert. These young men then (said they),
being sent out by their companions well furnished with sup-
plies of water and provisions, went first through the in-
habited country, and after they had passed through this
they came to the country of wild beasts, and after this they
passed through the desert, making their journey towards
the West Wind; and having passed through a great tract
of sand in many days, they saw at last trees growing in
a level place ; and having come up to them, they were
beginning to pluck the fruit which was upon the trees:
but as they began to pluck it, there came upon them small

Nasamonians understand anything of their speech nor could
those who were carrying them off understand anything of
the speech of the Nasamonians: and they led them (so it
was said) through very great swamps, and after passing
through these they carne to a city in which all the men were
in size like those who carried them off and in colour of
skin black; and by the city ran a great river, which ran
from the West towards the sunrising, and in it were seen

. crocodiles. Of the account given by Etearchos the Am—

monian let so much suffice as is here said, except that, as
the men of Kyrene told me, he alleged that the Nasamo-
nians returned safe home, and that the people to whom they
had corne were all wizards. Now this river which ran by
the city, Etearchos conjectured to be the Nile, and more-
