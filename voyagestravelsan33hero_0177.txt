THIRD VOYAGE 169

Spaniards which we had taken, if they would bring us to
water and fresh victuals; the rather by their meam, we ob-
tained of the inhabitants (Indians) what they had, which
was plentiful. These Indians were clothed and governed by
a Spaniam, which dwelt in the next town, not past a league
off. We stayed there all day, watering and wooding, and
providing things necessary, by giving content and satisfac-
tion of the Indians. But towards night our captain called
all of us aboard (only leaving the Spaniards lately taken in
the prize ashore, according to our promise made them, to
their great content; who acknowledged that our Captain did
them a far greater favour in setting them freely at liberty,
than he had done them displeasure in taking their ship)‚
and so set sail.

The sickness which had begun to kindle among us, two or
three days before, did this day shew itself, in CHARLES GLUB,
one of our Quarter-Masters‚ a very tall man, and a right
good mariner3 taken away, to the great grief both of Cap-
tain and company. What the cause of this malady was, we
knew not of certainty, we imputed it to the cold which our men
had taken, lying without succour in the pinnaces, But how-
soever it was, thus it pleased GOD to visit us, and yet in favour
to restore unto health all the rest of our company, that were
touched with this disease; which were not a few.

The next morning (15th November) being fair weather,
though the wind continued contrary, our Captain commanded
the Minzbn, his lesser pinnace, to hasten away before him
towards his ships at Fort Diego within the Cabecas [Head-
lands] to carry news of his coming, and to put all things in a
readiness for our land journey, if they heard anything of the
Fleet's arrival by the Cimaroons; giving the M inion charge
if they wanted wine, to take St. Bernards in their way, and
there take in some such portion as they thought good, of
the wines which we had there hidden in the sand.

We plied to windwards, as near as we could, so that
within seven-night after the Minion departed from us, we
came (22nd November) to St. Bernards, finding but twelve
botijos of wine of all the store we left, which had escaped
the curious search of the enemy, who had been there; for
they were deep in the ground.
