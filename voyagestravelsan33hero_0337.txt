DISCOVERY OF GUIANA 329

mar, que tenia la hortaliza‚ las flores, y arboles de 010 y
plata; invencion y grandeza hasta entonces nunca vista.
Allende de todo esto, tenia infinitisima cantidad de plata
y oro por labrar en el Cuzco, que se perdio por la muerte
de Guascar; ca 105 Indios 10 escondieron, viendo que
los Espafioles se 10 tomaban, y enviaban a Espafia.’ That is,
‘All the vessels 01 1115 house, table, and kitchen, were of
gold and silver, and the meanest of silver and copper 101·
strength and hardness 01 metal. He had in his wardrobe
hollow statues of gold which seemed giants, and the figures
in proportion and bigness 01 all the beasts, birds, trees, and
herbs, that the earth bringeth forth; and 01 all the fishes
that the sea or waters 01 1115 kingdom breedeth. He had
also ropes, budgets, chests‚ and troughs 01 gold and silver,

an infinite quantity 01 silver and gold unwrought in Cuzco,

it, which Lopez setteth down in these words following :—
‘ Hallaron cincuenta y dos mil marcos de buena plata, y un
millon y trecientos y veinte y seis mil y quinientos pesos de
oro.' Which is, ‘They found 52,ooo marks 01 good silver,
and 1‚326,500 pesas of gold! Now, although these reports
may seem strange, yet if we consider the many millions
which are daily brought out of Peru into Spain, we may
easily believe the same. For we find that by the abundant
treasure 01 that country the Spanish king vexes all the
princes 01 Europe, and is become, in a few year5‚ from a
poor king 01 Castile, the greatest monarch 01 this part of
