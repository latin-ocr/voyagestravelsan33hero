338 SIR WALTER RALEIGH

situate on the south side of the entrance, some 60 Ieagues
within the mouth of the said river. The memories of the
like women are very ancient as well in Africa as in Asia.
In Africa those that had Medusa for queen3 others in
Scythia, near the rivers of Tanais and Thermodon. We find,
also, that Lampedo and Marthesia were queens of the Ama-
zons. In many histories they are verified to have been, and
in divers ages and provinces; but they which are not far
from Guiana do accompany with men but once in a year, and
for the time of one month, which Ι gather by their relation,
to be in April ; and that time all kings of the borders assemble,
and queens of the Amazons‚· and after the queens have
chosen‚ the rest cast lots for their valentines. This one
month they feast, dance, and drink of their wines in abun-
dance ; and the moon being done they all depart to their own
provinces. '⁸‘ ’¹‘ * * They are said to be very cruel and
bloodthirsty, especially to such as offer to invade their terri-
tories. These Amazons have likewise great store of these
plates of gold, which they recover by exchange chiefly for
a kind of green stones‚ which the Spaniards call piedras
Izijadas, and we use for spleen—stones;²⁵ and for the disease
of the stone we also esteem them. Of these I saw divers in
Guiana; and commonly every king or caciqzte hath one,
which their wives for the most part wear, and they esteem
them as great jewels. Δ
But to return to the enterprise of Berreo, who, as I have
said, departed from Nuevo Reyno with 700 horse, besides
the provisions above rehearsed. He descended by the river
called Cassanar, which riseth in Nuevo Reyno out of the
mountains by the city of Tunja, from which mountain also
springeth Pat0‚· both which fall into the great river of Meta,
and Meta riseth from a mountain joining to Pamplona, in the
same Nuevo Reyno de Granada. These, as also Guaiam
which issueth out of the mountains by Timana, fall all into
Baraquan, and are but of his heads; for at their coming
together they lose their names, and Baraqnan farther down
is also rebaptized by the name of Orenoqzte. On the other
side of the city and hills of Timana riseth Rio Grande,
