As regards the Oracles both that among the Hellenes and

that in Libya, the Egyptians tell the following tale. The
priests of the Theban Zeus told me that two women in the
service of the temple had been carried away from Thebes
by Phenicians, and that they had heard that one of them
had been sold to go into Libya and the other to the Hellenes;
and these women, they said, were they who first founded
the prophetie seats among the nations which have been

temple gave accounts agreeing with theirs. Ι however have

did in truth carry away the consecrated women and sold one
of them into Libya and the other into Hellas, I suppose that
in the country now called Hellas, which was formerly called
Pelasgia, this woman was sold into the land of the Thespro·
tians; and then being a slave there she set up a sanctuary
of Zeus under a real oak-tree3 as indeed it was natural that
being an attendant of the sanctuary of Zeus at Thebes, she
should there, in the place to which she had come, have a
