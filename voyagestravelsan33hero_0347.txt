DISCOVERY OF GUIANA 339

which falleth into the sea by Santa Marta. By Cassanar
first, and so into Meta, Berreo passed, keeping his horsemen
on the banks‚ where the country served them for to march;
and where otherwise, he was driven to embark them in boats
which he builded for the purpose, and so came with the
current down the river of Meta, and so into Baraquan.
After he entered that great and mighty river, he began daily
to lose of his companies both men and horse3 for it is in
many places violently swift, and hath forcible eddies, many
sands, and divers islands sharp pointed with rocks. But
after one whole year, journeying for the most part by river,
and the rest by land, he grew daily to fewer numbers; for
both by sickness, and by encountering with the people of
those regions thorough which he travelled, his companies
were much wasted‚ especially by divers encounters with the
Amapaians.²⁸ And in all this time he never could learn of
any passage into Gaiana, nor any news or fame thereos,
until he came to a further border of the said Amapaia, eight
days’ journey from the river Εατνοῖί,27 which was the furthest
river that he entered. Among those of Amapaia, Gaiana
was famous; but few of these people accosted Berreo, or
would trade with him the first three months of the six which
he sojourned there. This Amapaia is also marvellous rich in
gold, as both Berreo confessed and those of Guiana with
whom I had most conference; and is situate upon Orenoque
also. In this country Berreo lost sixty of his best soldiers‚
and most of all his horse that remained in his former year’s
travel. But in the end, after divers encounters with those
nations‚ they grew to peace, and they presented Berreo with
ten images of fine gold among divers other plates and
croissants, which, as he sware to me, and divers other
gentlemen‚ were so curiously wrought, as he had not seen
the like either in I tuly, Spain, or the Low Cozmtries; and
he was resolved that when they came to the hands of the
Spanish king, to whom he had sent them by his camp-master,
they would appear very admirable, especially being wroughr
-by such a nation as had no iron instruments at all, nor any

''Amapaia was Berrio’s name for the Orinoco valley above the Caura
nxggihe Caroni river, the first great affluent of the Orinoco on the south,
about 180 miles from the sea.
