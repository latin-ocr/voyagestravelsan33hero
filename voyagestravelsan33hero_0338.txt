the world, and likely every day to increase if other princes
forslow the good occasions offered, and suffer him to add
this empire to the rest, which by far exceedeth all the rest.
If his gold now endanger us, he will then be unresistible.
Such of the Spaniards as afterwards endeavoured the con-
quest thereos, whereof there have been many, as shall be
declared hereafter, thought that this Inga, of whom this
emperor now living is descended, took his way by¹ the river
of Amazons, by that branch which is called Papamene.²⁴
For by that way followed Orellana, by the commandment of
Ganzalo Pizarro, in the year 1542, whose name the river
also beareth this day. Which is also by others alled Mara-
non, although Andrew Thevet doth affirm that between
Maranon and Amazons there are 120 leagues; but sure it
is that those rivers have one head and beginning, and the
Μαναῆοη, which Thevet describeth‚ is but a branch of
Amazons or Orellana, of which I will speak more in another
place. It was attempted by Ordas; but it is now little less
than 70 years since that Diego Ordas, a Knight of the order
of Santiago, attempted the same; and it was in the year
1542 that Orellana discovered the river of Amazons; but
the first that ever saw Manoa was Juan Martinez, master of
the munitiori to Ordas. At a port called Μονείμιὶιο,1ὶῖ in
Gaiana, there lieth at this day a great anchor of Ordas his
ship. And this port is some 300 miles within the land, upon
the great river of Orenoque. 1 rested at this port four days,
twenty days after I left the ships at Curiapan.

The relation of this Martinez, who was the first that dis-
covered Manoa, his success, and end, is to be seen in the
Chancery of St. suan de Puerto Rico, whereof Berreo had a
copy, which appeared to be the greatest encouragement as well
to Berreo as to others that formerly attempted the discovery
and conquest. mezzana, after he failed of the discovery of
Gaiana by the said river of Amazons, passed into Spain,
and there obtained a patent of the king for the invasion and
conquest, but died by sea about the islands3 and his fleet
being severed by tempest, the action for that time proceeded
not. Diego Ordas followed the enterprise, and departed
