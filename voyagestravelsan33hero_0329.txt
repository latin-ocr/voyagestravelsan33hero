THE DISCOVERY' OF GUIANA³

N Thursday, the sixth of February, in the year 1595,
O we departed Eugland, and the Sunday following had

sight of the north cape of Spain, the wind t'or the most
part continuing prosperous; we passed in sight ot* the Bur-
lings, and the Rock, and so onwards for the Canaries, and fell
with Fuerteventura the 17. of the same month, where we
spent two or three days, and relieved our companies with
some fresh meat. From thence we coasted by the Grano' Ca-
naria, and so to Teneriffe, and stayed there for the Lion’s
When), your Lordship's ship, and for Captain Amyas Preston
and the rest. But when after seven or eight days we found them
not, we departed and directed our course t’or Trinidad, with
mine own ship, and a small barque of Captain Cross’s only;
for we had before lost sight of a small galego on the coast
of Spain, which came with us from Plymoutlz. We ar-
rived at Trinidczd the 22. of March, casting anchor at Point
Curiapan, which the Spaniards call szta cle Gallo, which is
situate in eight degrees or thereabouts. we abode there
four or five days, and in all that time we came not to the
speech of any Indian or Spaniard. On the coast we saw a
fire, as we sailed from the Point Carao towards Curiapan,
but for sear of the Spaniards none durst come to speak with
us, I myself coasted it in my barge close aboard the shore
and landed in every cove‚ the better to know the island,
while the ships kept the charmel. From Curiapan after a
few days we turned up north-east to recover that place
which the Spaniards call Puerto de los Espczszole‘s,⁵ and the
inhabitants Conquerabia; and as before, revictualling my
barge, I left the ships and kept by the shore, the better to
come to speech with some of the inhabitants, and also to

:gffglzzaggrps derived from the Guayano Indians, on the Orinoco.
⁵Now Port οἱ Spain.
