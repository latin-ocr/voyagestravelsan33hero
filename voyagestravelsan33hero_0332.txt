324 SIR WALTER RALEIGH

the relief of those English which I had planted in Vir-
ginia, whereof the bruit was come among them; which I had ¹
performed in my return, if extremity of weather had not
forced me from the said coast.

I found occasions of staying in this place for two causes.
The one was to be revenged ot' Berreo, who the year before,
1594, had betrayed eight ot' Captain Whia’don’s men, and Ι
took thern while he departed from them to seek the Edward
Bonaventure, which arrived at Trinidad the day before from
the East Indies: in whose absence Berreo sent a canoa aboard
the pinnace only with Indians and dogs inviting the com-
pany to go with them into the woods to kill a deer. Who,
like wise men, in the absence of their captain followed the
Indiam, but were no sooner one arquebus shot from the
shore, but Berreo's soldiers lying in ambush had them all,
notwithstanding that he had given his word to captain
Whiddon that they should take water and wood safely.
The other cause of my stay was, for that by discourse with
the Spaniards Ι daily learned more and more ot' Gaiana, of
the rivers and passages, and of the enterprise of Berreo, by
what means or fault he failed, and how he meant to prose-
cute the same.

While we thus spent the time Ι was assured by another
cac-ique of the north side of the island, that Berreo had sent
to Margarita and Cumana for soldiers‚ meaning to have
given me a cassad0⁸ at parting, if it had been possible.
For although he had given order through all the island that
no Indian should come aboard to trade with me upon pain
of hanging and quartering (having executed two of them
for the same, which I afterwards found), yet every night
there came some with most lamentable complaints of his
cruelty: how he had divided the island and given to every
soldier a part; that he made the ancient caciques, which were
lords of the country, to be their slaves; that he kept them
in chains, and dropped their naked bodies with burning
bacon, and such other torments‚ which I found afterwards
to be true. For in the city, after Ι entered the same, there
were five of the lords or little kings, which they call caciques
in the W est Indies, in one chain, almost dead-of famine, and

⁸ C achacio (cachada)=a blow.
