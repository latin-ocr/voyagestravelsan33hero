382 SIR WALTER RALEIGH

march down the said valley as far as a river called Cumaea,
where Ι promised to meet him again, Putijma himself
promising also to be his guide. And as they marched, they
left the towns of Emperapana and Capurepana on the right
hand, and marched from Putijma’s house, down the said
valley of Amariocapana3 and we returning the same day to
the river’s side, saw by the way many rocks like unto gold
ore, and on the left hand a round mountain which consisted
of mineral stone.

From hence we rowed down the stream, coasting the
province of Parino. As for the branches of rivers which Ι
overpass in this discourse‚ those shall be better expressed in ·
the description, with the mountains of Aio, Ara, and the
rest, which are situate in the provinces of Parino and Car-
ricurri-na. When we were come as far down as the land
called Ariacoa, where Orenoque divideth itself into three
great branehes, each of them being most goodly rivers, 1
sent away Captain Henry Thyn, and Captain Greenv'ile with
the galley, the nearest way, and took with me Captain
Gifford, Captain Caulfield, Edward Fortem and captain
Eynos with mine own barge and the two wherries, and
went down that branch of Orenoque which is called Cara-
roopana, which leadeth towards Emeria, the province of
Campana, and towards the east sea, as well to find out Cap-
tain Keymis, whom Ι had sent overland‚ as also to acquaint
myself with Campana, who is one of the greatest of all the
lords of the Orenoqueponi. And when Ι came to the river
of Cumaea, to which Putijma promised to conduct Captain
Keymis, Ι left Captain Eynos and Master Porter in the said
river to expect his coming, and the rest of us rowed down
the stream towards Emeria.

In this branch called Cararoopana were also many goodly
islands‚ some of six miles long, some of ten, and some of
twenty. When it grew towards sunset, we entered a branch
of a river that fell into Orenoque, called Winicapora; where
I was informed of the mountain of crystal, to which in truth
for the length of the way, and the evil season of the year,
Ι was not able to march, nor abide any longer upon the
journey. We saw it afar off; and it appeared like a white
church-tower of an exceeding height. There falleth over it
