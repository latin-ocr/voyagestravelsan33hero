FAMOUS VOYAGE
ROUND THE WORLD

NARRATIVE BY FRANCIS PRETTY,
oNE OF DRAKE¹S GENTLEMEN AT ARMS.

The FAMOUS VOYAGE of SIR FRANCIS DRAKE into the South Sea,
and tlzerehence about the whole Globe of the Earth, begun in tlte
year of our Lord 1577.

HE 15. day of November, in the year of our Lord
Ι 1577, Master Francis Drake, with a fieet of five
ships and barks,² and to the number of 164 men,
gentlemen and sailors, departed from Plymoutlz‚ giving out
his pretended voyage for Alexandria. But the wind falling
contrary, he was forced the next morning to put into
Falmouth Haven, in Cornwall, where such and so terrible
a tempest took us, as few men have seen the like, and was
indeed so vehement that all our ships were like to have gone
to wrack. But it pleased God to preserve us from that ex-
tremity, and to afflict us only for that present with these
two particulars: the mast of our Admiral‚ which was the
Pelican, was cut overboard for the safeguard of the ship‚
and the Marigold was driven ashore, and somewhat bruised.
For the repairing of which damages we returned again to
Plymouth‚· and having recovered those harms, and brought
the ships again to good state, we set forth the second time
from Plymouth, and set sail the 13. day of December
following.
The 25. day of the same month we fell with the Cape

1The Pelican 120 tons, commanded by Drake; the Effeabeffl, a new
Deptfo'rd-built sfiipstf 80 tons, commanded by winter, with her pinnace the
Remedia,- the Μανιροῖἀ, of 3ο tons; and the Swan, a fly-boat οἱ 50 tons·
