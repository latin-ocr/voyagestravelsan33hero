372 SIR WALTER RALEIGH

is called Arui, which also runneth thorough the lake Cassipa,
and falleth into Orenoque farther west, making all that land
between Caroli and Arni an island3 which is likewise a
most beautiful country. Next unto Arni there are two
rivers Atoica and Caura, and on that branch which is called
Caura are a nation of people whose heads appear not above
their shoulders; which though it may be thought a mere
sable, yet for mine own part Ι am resolved it is true,
because every child in the provinces of Aromaia and
Canum· affirm the same. They are called Ewaipanoma; they
are reported to have their eyes in their shoulders, and their
mouths in the middle of their breasts, and that a long train
' of hair groweth backward between their shoulders. The
son of Topiawari, which I brought with me into England,
told me that they were the most mighty men of all the land,
and use bows, arrows, and clubs thrice as big as any of Gaiana,
or of the Orenoqzaeeponi; and that one oi the [warawaqueri
took a prisoner of them the year before our arrival there,
and brought him into the borders of Aromaia, his father’s
country. And farther‚ when Ι seemed to doubt of it, he
told me that it was no wonder among them; but that they
were as great a nation and as common as any other in all
the provinces, and had or⁸ late years slain many hundreds of
his father’s people, and of other nations their neighbours.
But it was not my chance to hear of them till Ι was come
away; and if I had but spoken one word of it while I was
there Ι might have brought one of them with me to put
the matter out of doubt. Such a nation was written of by
Mandeville, whose reports were holden for fables many
years; and yet since the East Indies were discovered, we
find his relations true of such things as heretofore were
held incredible.4⁶ Whether it be true or no, the matter is
not great, neither can there be any profit in the imagina-
tion; for mine own part I saw them not, but Ι am resolved
that so many people did not all combine or forethink to
make the report.

When I came to Cumana in the West Indies afterwards
by chance Ι spake with a Spaniard dwelling not far from

4⁶Mandeville, or the author who assumed this name, placed his headless
men in the East Indian Archipelago. The fable is borrowed from older
writers (Herodotus, iv. 191, δια).
