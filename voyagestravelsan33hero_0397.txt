DISCOVERY OF GUIANA 389

we had lost thern all. And therefore Ι held my first resolu-
tion, that her Majesty should either accept or refuse the
enterprise ere anything should be done that might in any
sort hinder the same. And if Peru had so many heaps of
gold, whereof those [ngas were princes, and that they de·
lighted so much therein, no doubt but this which now liveth
and reigneth in Manoa hath the same humour‚⁵¹ and, Ι am
assured, hath more abundance of gold within his territory
than all Peru and the West I adies.

For the rest, which myself have seen, Ι will promise these
things that follow which Ι know to be true. Those that
are desirous to discover and to see many nations may be
satisfied within this river, which bringeth forth so many
arms and branches leading to several countries and prov-
inces, above 2‚ooo miles east and west and 800 miles south
and north, and of these the most either rich in gold or in
other merchandises. The common soldier shall here fight
for gold, and pay himself, instead of pence, with plates of
half—a-foot broad, whereas he breaketh his bones in other
wars for provant ⁵² and penury. Those commanders and
chieftains that shoot at honour and abundance shall find
there more rich and beautiful cities‚ more temples adorned
with golden images, more sepulchres filled with treasure‚
than either C ortes found in M exico or Pizarro in Peru. And
the shining glory of this conquest will eclipse all those so
far-extended bearns of the Spanish nation. There is no
country which yieldeth more pleasure to the inhabitants,
either for those common delights of hunting, hawking, fish·
ing, fowling, and the rest, than Guiana doth ; it hath so many
plains, clear rivers, and abundance of pheasants, partridges,
quails, rails, cranes‚ herons, and all other fowl; deer of all
sorts, porks‚ hares, lions, tigrem, leopards, and divers other
sorts of beasts, either for chase or food. It hath a kind of
beast called cama or anta,53 as big as an English bees, and
in great plenty. To speak of the several sorts of every kind
I sear would be troublesorne to the reader, and therefore Ι
will omit thern, and conclude that both for health, good air,
pleasure, and riches‚ Ι am resolved it cannot be equalled by
any region either in the east or west. Moreover the country

'⁵² Hakluyt reads ‘ honour! ⁵² Provender‚ food. ⁵³ The tapir.
