DISCOVERY OF GUIANA 357

carne away in those canoas,· one of them was a cavallero,
as the captain of the Arwacas after told us, another a
soldier and the third a refiner.

In the meantime, nothing on the earth could have been
more welcome to ηε, next unto gold, than the great store
of very excellent bread which we found in these canoas;
for now our men cried, Let us go on, we care not how
far. After tha't Captain Gifford had brought the two canoas
to the galley, Ι took my barge and went to the bank’s side
with a dozen shot, where the canoas first ran themselves
η ashore, and landed there, sending out Captain Gifford and
captain Thyn on one hand and Captain Caulfield on the
other, to follow those that were fled into the woods, And

to all. For when the springs began to break, and the
rivers to raise themselves so suddenly as by no means we
could abide the digging of any mine, especially for that
the richest are defended with rocks of hard stones, which
we call the white Spar, and that it required both time, men,
and instruments fit for such a work, Ι thought it best not ‚
to hover thereabouts, lest if the same had been perceived
by the company, there would have been by this time many
barks and ships set out, and perchance other nations would
also have gotten of ours for pilots. So as both ourselves
