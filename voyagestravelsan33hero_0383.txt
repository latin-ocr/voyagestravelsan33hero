DISCOVERY OF GUIANA 375

began daily to threaten us with dangers in our return. For
no half day passed but the river began to rage and overflow
yery fearfully, and the rains came down in terrible showers,
and gusts in great abundance; and withal our men began to
cry out for want of shift, for no man had place to bestow
any other apparel than that which he ware on his back, and
