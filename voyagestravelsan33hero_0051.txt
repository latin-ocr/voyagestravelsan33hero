EGYPT ’ 43

a corpse is conveyed to thern, show to those who brought it
wooden models of corpses made like reality by painting, and
the best of the ways of embalming they say is that of him
whose name Ι think it impiety to mention when speaking
of a matter ot such a kind; the second which they show is
less good than this and also less expensive; and the third is
the least expensive of all. Having told them about this, they
inquire of thern in which way they desire the corpse of their
friend to be prepared. Then they after they have agreed
for a certain price depart out of the way, and the others
being left behind in the buildings embalm according to the
best of these ways thus t—First with a crooked iron tool
they draw out the brain through the nostrils, extracting it
partly thus and partly by pouring in drugs; and after this
with a sharp stone of Ethiopia they make a cut along the
side and take out the whole contents of the belly, and when
they have cleared out the cavity and cleansed it with palm-
wine they cleanse it again with spices pounded up: then they
fill the belly with pure myrrh pounded up and with cassia and
other spices except frankincense, and sew it together again.
Having so done they keep it for embalming covered up in
natron for severity dayS‚ but for a longer time than this

fine linen cut into bands, smearing these beneath with gum,
which the Egyptians use generally instead of glue. Then
the kinsfolk receive it from thern and have a wooden figure
made in the shape of a man, and when they have had this
made they enclose the corpse, and having shut it up within,
they store it then in a sepulchral chamber, setting it to stand
upright against the wall. Thus they deal with the corpses
which are prepared in the most costly way; but for those who
desire the middle way and wish to avoid great eost they
prepare the corpse as follows :--having filled their syringes
with the oil which is got from cedar-wood, with this they
forthwith fill the belly of the corpse, and this they do without
having either cut it open or taken out the bowels, but they
inject the oil by the breech, and having stopped the drench
from returning back they keep it then the appointed number
of days for embalming, and on the last of the days they let
