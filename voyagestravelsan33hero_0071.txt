EGYPT 63

distinguished from all other men, so was he from the other
Egyptians.

After these things they said this king went down alive
to that place which by the Hellenes is called Hades, and
there played at dice with Demeter, and in some throws
he overcame her and in others he was overcome by her;
and he came back again having as a gift from her a hand-
kerchief of gold: and they told me that because of the
going down of Rhampsinitos the Egyptians after he carne
back celebrated a feast, which I know of my own knowl-
edge also that they still observe even to my time ; but
whether it is for this cause that they keep the feast or
for some other, Ι am not able to say. However, the priests
weave a robe completely on the very day of the feast,
and forthwith they bind up the eyes of one of them with
a fillet, and having led him with the robe to the way by
which one goes to the temple of Demeter, they depart
back again themselves. This priest‚ they say, with his
eyes bound up is led by two wolves to the temple of De-

then afterwards the wolves lead him back again from the
temple to the same spot. Now as to the tales told by the
Egyptians, any man may accept them to whom such things

that Demeter and Dionysos are rulers of the world below;
and the Egyptians are also the first who reported the doctrine
that the soul of man is immortal, and that when the body
dies, the soul enters into another creature which chances
then to be coming to the birth, and when it has gone
the round of all the creatures of land and sea and of the
air, it enters again into a human body as it comes to the
birth; and that it makes this round in a period of three
thousand years. This doctrine certain Hellenes adopted,
some earlier and some later, as if it were of their own
invention, and of these men I know the names but Ι abstain
from recording them.

Down to the time when Rhampsinitos was king, they
told me there was in Egypt nothing but orderly rule, and
