226 DRAKE’S FAMOUS VOYAGE

white banks and cliffs, which lie towards the sea, and the
other, because it might have some affinity with our country
in name, which sometime was so called. There is no part
of earth here to be taken up, wherein there is not some
probable show of gold or silver.

At our departure hence our General set up a monument
of our being there, as also of her Majesty’s right and title
to the same, namely a plate, nailed upon a fair great post,
whereupon was engraved her MaJ'esty's name, the day and
year ot* our arrival there, with the free giving up of the
province and people into her Majesty's hands, together with
her Highness' picture and arms, in a piece of six penee of
current English money, under the plate, whereunder was
also written the name of our General.

It seemeth that the Spaniards hitherto had never been in
this part ot‘ the country, neither did ever discover the land
by many degrees to the southwards of this place.

After we had set sail from hence, we continued without

day in the morning we fell with certain islands eight degrees
to the northward of the line, from which islands came a
great number of canoas, having in some of them four, in
some six, and in some also fourteen men, bringing with them
cocos and other fruits. Their canoas were hollow within,
and cut with great art and cunning, being very smooth
within and without, and bearing a glass14 as if it were a
horn daintily burnished, having a prow and a stern of one
sort, yielding inward circle-wise, being of a great height,
and full of certain white shells for a bravery; and on each
side of them lie out two pieces of timber about a yard and
a half long, more or less, according to the smallness or big-
ness of the boat. These people have the nether part of their
ears cut into a round circle, hanging down very low upon
their cheeks, whereon they hang things ot* a reasonable
weight. The nails of their hands are an inch long, their
teeth are as black as pitch‚ and they renew them often, by
eating of an herb with a kind of powder, which they always
carry about them in a eane for the same purpose.
