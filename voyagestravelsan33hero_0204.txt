196 SIR FRANCIS DRAKE

to march back the very sels-same way that we came, we
heard both horse and foot coming as it seemed to the mules:
for they never followed us, after we were once entered the
woods, where the French captain by reason of his wound,
not able to travel farther‚ stayed, in hope that some rest
would recover him better strength.

But after we had marched some two leagues, upon the

. French soldiers' complaint, that they missed one of their ι

men also, examination being made whether he were slain or
not: it was found that he had drunk much wine, and over-
lading himself with pillage, and hasting to go before us, had
lost himself in the woods. And as we afterwards knew, he
was taken by the Spaniards that evening; and upon torture,
discovered unto thern where we had hidden our treasure.

We continued our march all that and the next day (and
and 3rd April) towards Rio Francisco, in hope to meet with
our pinnaces; but when we carne thither, looking out to sea,
we saw seven Spanish pinnaces, which had been searching
all the coast thereabouts: whereupon we mightily suspected
that they had taken or spoiled our pinnaces, for that our
Captain had given so straight charge, that they should re-
pair to this place this afternoon; from the Cabecas where
they rode ; whence to our sight these Spaniards’ pinnaces did
come.

But the night before, there had fallen very much rain, with
much westerly wind, which as it enforced the Spaniards to
return home the sooner, by reason of the storm: so it kept
our pinnaces, that they could not keep the appointment;
because the wind was contrary, and blew so strong, that with
their oars they could all that day get but half the way.
Notwithstanding‚ if they had followed our Captain's direc-
tion in setting forth over night, while the wind served‚ they
had arrived at the place appointed with far less labour, but
with far more danger: because that very day at noon, the
shallops manned out, of purpose, from Nombre de Dios, were
come to this place to take our pinnaces: imagining where we
were, after they had heard of our intercepting of the
treasure.

Our Captain seeing the shallops, feared least having taken
our pinnaces, they had compelled our men by torture to
