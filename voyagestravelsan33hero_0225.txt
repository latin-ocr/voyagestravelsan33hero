ROUND THE WORLD 217

We continuing our course, fell the 29. of November with
an island called La Mocha, where we cast anchor; and our
General, hoisting out our boat, went with ten of our corn-
pany to shore. Where we found people, whom the cruel and
extreme dealings of the Spaniards have forced, for their
own safety and liberty, to fiee from the main, and to fortify
themselves in this island. 'We being on land, the people came
down to us to the water side with show of great courtesy‚
bringing to us potatoes, roots, and two very fat sheep ; which
our General received, and gave them other things for them,
and had promised to have water there. But the next day

thinking us to have been Spaniards, and their friends,
welcomed us with a drum, and made ready a botija⁹ of wine
of Chili to drink to us. But as soon as we were entered, one
of our company called Thomas M oon began to lay about him,
and struck one of the Spaniards, and said unto him, Abaxo,
perro! that is in English. ‘ Go down, dog! ' One of these
Spaniards, seeing persons of that quality in those seas, all

them under hatches, all save one Spaniard, who suddenly
and desperately leapt overboard into the sea, and swam
