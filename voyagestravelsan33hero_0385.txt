DISCOVERY OF GUIANA 37⁷

for their defenee, they should be in danger of the Spaniards
in my absence, who Ι knew would use the same measures
towards mine that I offered them at Trinidad. And al-
though upon the motion Captain Caulfield, Captain Green-
vile, my nephew John Gilbert and divers others were de-'
sirous to stay, yet I was resolved that they must needs have
perished. For Berreo expected daily a supply out of Spain,
and looked also hourly for his son to come down from Nuevo
Reyno de Granada, with many horse and foot, and had also
in V alencia, in the Caracas, two hundred horse ready to
march; and I could not have spared above forty, and had
not any store at all of powder, lead, or match to have left
with them, nor any other provision, either spade, pickaxe, or
aught else to have fortified withal.

When I had given him reason that I could not at this time
leave him such a company, he then desired me to forbear

Spaniards sought his death; and as they had already mur-

had him seventeen days in a chain before he was king of
the country, and led him like a dog from place to place until
he had paid an hundred plates of gold and divers chains of
spleen-stones for his ransom.⁴⁹ And nOW, since he became
owner of that province, that they had many times laid wait
to take him, and that they would be now more vehement
when they should understand of his conferenee with the
English. And because, said he, they would the better dis-
plant me, if they cannot lay hands on me, they have gotten
a nephew of mine called Eparacano, whom they have chris-
tened Don Juan, and his son Don Pedro, whom they have
also apparelzed ancl armed‚ by whom they seek to make a
party against me in mine own country. He also hath taken,
io wife one Louiana‚ of a strong family, which are borderers
and neighbours,· and myself now being old and in the hands
of death am not able to travel nor to shift as when Ι was of
