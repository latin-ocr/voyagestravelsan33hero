TmRD VOYAGE 1³7

not to depart before he had built his pinnaces; which were
yet aboard in pieces: for which purpose he knew this port
to be a most convenient place.

And therefore as soon as we had moored our ships, our
Captain commanded his pinnaces to be brought ashore for
the carpenters to set up; himself employing all his other
company in fortifying a place (which he had chosen out, as a
most fit plot) of three—quarters of an acre of ground, to make
some strength or safety for the present, as sufficiently as the
means he had would afford. Which was performed by fell-
ing of great trees; bowsing and hauling them together, with
great pulleys and hawsers, until they were enclosed to the
water; and then letting others fall upon them, until they had =
raised with trees and boughs thirty feet in height round
about, leaving only one gate to issue at, near the water
side; which every night, that we might sleep in more
safety and security, was shut up, with a great tree drawn
athwart it.

The whole plot was built in pentagonal form, to wit, of
five equal sides and angles, of which angles two were
toward the sea, and that side between them was left open,
for the easy launching of our pinnaces: the other four
equal sides were wholly, excepting the gate before men-
tioned, firmly closed up.

Without, instead of a trench‚ the ground was rid [laid
bare] for fifty feet space, round about. The rest was very
thick with trees, of which many were of those kinds which
are never without green leaves, till they are dead at the
root: excepting only one kind of tree amongst them, much
like to our Ash, which when the sun cometh right over
them, causing great rains, suddenly casteth all its leaves,
viz., within three days, and yet within six days after be-
comes all green again. The leaves of the other trees do
also in part fall away, but so as the trees continue still
green notwithstanding: being of a marvellous height, and
supported as it were with five or six natural buttresses
growing out of their bodies so far, that three men may so
be hidden in each of them, that they which shall stand in
the very next buttress shall not be able to see them. One
of them specially was marked to have had seven of those
