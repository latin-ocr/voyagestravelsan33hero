procuring them some little benefit to encourage them, and to nourish
this ready and willing disposition of theirs‚ both in them and in
others by their example, against any other time of like occasion.
But because it may be supposed that herein we forget not the
private benefit of ourselves, and are thereby the rather moved to
incline ourselves to this composition, we do therefore think good
for the clearing ourselves of all such suspicion, to declare hereby, that
what part or portion soever it be of this ransom or composition
for Carthagena which should come unto us, we do freely give and
bestow the same wholly upon the poor men who have remained with

could use: for the Spanish boats, upon the sight of our
pinnaees coming towards them, ran themselves ashore, and
so their men presently hid themselves in bushes hard by the
sea—side, amongst some others that had called them by signs
thither. Our men presently without any due regard had to
the quality of the place, and seeing no man of the Spaniards
to shew themselves, boarded the Spanish barks or boats, and
so standing all open in them, were suddenly shot at by a
troop of Spaniards out of the bushes; by which volley of
shot there were slain Captain Varney, which died presently,
and Captain M oon, who died some few days after, besides
some four or five others that were hurt: and so our folks
returned without their purpose, not having any sufficient
number of soldiers with thern to fight on shore. For those
men they carried were all mariners to row, few of them
