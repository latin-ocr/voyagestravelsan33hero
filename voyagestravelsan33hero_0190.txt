182 SIR FRANCIS DRAKE

for the most part, so that the loss of them were far less if
the worst befell, and yet they should serve to discover them
as well as the best.

Thus by the recklessness of one of our company, and by
the carefulness of this traveller; we were disappointed of a
most rich booty: which is to be thought GOD would not

The other two Recuas were no sooner come up to us, but
being stayed and seized on. One of the Chief Carriers, a
