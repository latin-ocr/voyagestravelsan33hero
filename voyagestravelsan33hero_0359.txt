DISCOVERY OF GUIANA 351

the river side and got upon a tree‚ and, as we were coasting,
leaped down and swam to the barge half dead with fear.
But our good hap was that we kept the other old Indian,
which we handfasted to redeem our pilot withal; for, being
natural of those rivers, we assured ourselves that he knew
the way better than any stranger could. And, indeed, but
for this chance, I think we had never found the way either
to Gaiana or back to our ships; for Ferdinando after a few
days knew nothing at all, nor which way to turn; yea, and
many times the old man himself was in great doubt which
river to take. Those people which dwell in these broken
islands and drowned lands are generally called Tivitivas.
There are οἱ them two sorts; the one called C inwanfi, and the
other W araweete.

The great river of Orenoque or Baraquan hath nine
branches which fall out on the north side of his own main
mouth. On the south side it hath seven other fallings into the
sea, so it disemboqueth by sixteen arms in all, between
islands and broken ground; but the islands are very great,
many of them as big as the Isle of Wight, and bigger, and
many less. From the first branch on the north to the last
of the south it is at least 100 leagues, so as the river's mouth
is 300 miles wide at his entrance into the sea, which I take
to be far bigger than that of Amazons. All those that in-
habit in the mouth of this river upon the several north
branches are these Tivitivas, of which there are two chief
lords which have continual wars one with the other. The
islands which lie on the right hand are called Pallamos, and
the land on the left, Hororotomaka; and the river by which
John Douglas returned within the land from Amana to
Capuri they call Macuri.

These Tivitivas are a very goodly people and very valiant,
and have the most manly speech and most deliberate that ever
I heard of what nation soever. In the summer they have
houses on the ground, as in other places ; in the winter they
dwell upon the trees, where they build very artificial towns
and villages, as it is written in the Spanish story of the
West Indies that those people do in the low lands near the
gulf of Uraba. For between May and September the river
of Orenoque riseth thirty foot upright, and then are those
