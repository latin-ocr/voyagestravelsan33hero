28 HERODOTUS

that the Hellenes when they tell this tale are altogether
without knowledge of the nature and customs of the Egyp-
tians; for how should they for whom it is not lawful to
sacrifice even beasts, except swine and the males of oxen
and calves (such of them as are clean) and geese, how
should these sacrifice human beings? Besides this, how
is it in nature possible that Heracles, being one person only
and moreover a man (as they assert), should slay many
myriads? Having said so much of these matters, we pray
that we may have grace from both the gods and the heroes
for our speech.

Now the reason why those of the Egyptians whom I
have mentioned do not sacrifice goats‚ female or male, is
this:——the Mendesians count Pan to be one of the eight
gods (now these eight gods they say came into being be-

represent in painting and in sculpture the figure of Pan,
just as the Hellenes do, with goat’s face and legs, not
supposing him to be really like this but to resemble the
other gods; the cause however why they represent him in
this form I prefer not to say. The Mendesians then
reverence all goats and the males more than the females
(and the goatherds too have greater honour than other
herdsmen), but of the goats one especially is reverenced,
and when he dies there is great mourning in all the Mende-

Egyptian tongue Mendes. Moreover in my lifetime there
happened in that district this marvel, that is to say a he-goat
had intercourse with a woman publicly‚ and this was so
done that all men might have evidence of it.

The pig is accounted by the Egyptians an abominable
animal; and first, it' any of them in passing by touch a
pig, he goes into the river and dips himself forthwith in the
water together with his garments; and then too swine-
herds, though they be native Egyptians, unlike all others do
not enter any of the temples in Egypt, nor is anyone willing
to give his daughter in marriage to one of them or to take
a wife from among them; but the swineherds both give in
marriage to one another and take from one another. Now
to the other gods the Egyptians do not think it right to
