44 HERODOTUS

the cedar oil come out from the belly‚ which they before put
in; and it has such power that it brings out with it the
bowels and interior organs of the body dissolved; and the
natron dissolves the flesh, so that there is left of the corpse
only the skin and the bones. When they have done this they
give back the corpse at once in that condition without work-

¹ which are prepared the bodies of those who have less means,
is as follows z—they cleanse out the belly with a purge and
then keep the body for embalming during the seventy days,
and at once after that they give it back to the bringers to
carry away. The wives of men of rank when they die are
not given at once to be embalmed, nor such women as are

him, but the priests of the Nile themselves handle the corpse
and bury it as that of one who was something more than

Hellenic usages they will by no means follow, and to
speak generally they follow those of no other men whatever.
This rule is observed by most of the Egyptians; but there
is a large city named Chemmis in the Theban district near
Neapolis, and in this city there is a temple of Perseus the
son of Danae which is of a square shape‚ and round it grow
date-palms: the gateway of the temple is built of stone and
of very great size, and at the entrance of it stand two great
statues of stone. Within this enclosure is a temple-house
and in it stands an image of Perseus. These people of
Chemmis say that Perseus is wont often to appear in their
