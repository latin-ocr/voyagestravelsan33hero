EGYPT 25

The clean males then of the ox kind, both full-grown
animals and ealves, are sacr:.·'.:e<1 by all the Egyptians;
the females however they may not sacrifice, but these are
sacred to Isis; for the figure of Isis is in the form of a
woman with cow's horns, just as the Hellenes present Io in
pictures, and all the Egyptians without distinction reverence
cows far more than any other kind of cattle; for which
reason neither man nor woman of Egyptian race would
kiss a man who is a Hellene on the mouth, nor will they
use a knife or roasting-spits or a caldron belonging to a
Hellene, nor taste of the flesh even of a clean animal if it
has been cut with the knife of a Hellene. And the cattle
of this kind which die they bury in the following manner:—
the females they cast into the river, but the males they
bury, each people in the suburb of their town, with one
of the horns, or sometimes both, protruding to mark the
place; and when the bodies have rotted away and the ap-
pointed time comes on, then to each city comes a boat from
that which is called the island of Prosopitis (this is in the
Delta, and the extent of its eurcuit is nine schoines). In
this island of Prosopitis is situated‚ besides many other
cities, that one from which the boats come to take up the
bones of the oxen, and the name of the city is Atarbechis,
and in it there is set up a holy temple of Aphrodite. From
this city many go abroad in various directions, some to
one city and· others to another, and when they have dug up
the bones of the oxen they carry them off, and coming to-
gether they bury them in one single place. In the same
manner as they bury the oxen they bury also their other
cattle when they die; for about them also they have the
same law laid down, and these also they abstain from kill-
mg.

Now all who have a temple set up to the Theban Zeus
or who are of the district of Thebes, these, I say, all sacri-
fice goats and abstain from sheep: for not all the Egyp-
tians equally reverence the same gods, except only Isis
and Osiris (who they say is Dionysos), these they all
reverence alike: but they who have a temple ot' Mendes or
belong to the Mendesian district, these abstain from goats
and sacrifice sheep. Now the men of Thebes and those
