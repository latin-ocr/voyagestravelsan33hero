After our going hence, which was the 14. of September,
in the year of our Lord 1585, and taking our course towards
Spain, we had the wind for a few days somewhat scant, and
sometimes calm. And being arrived near that part of Spain
which is called the M oors,⁸ we happened to espy divers sain,
which kept their course close by the shore, the weather being
fair and calm. The General caused the vice-Admiral to go
with the pinnaces well manned to see what they were3 who
upon sight of the said pinnaces approaching near unto them,
abandoned for the most part all their ships, being Frenchrnen‚
laden all with salt, and bound homewards into France.
Amongst which ships, being all of small burthen, there was
one so well liked, which also had no man in her, as being
brought unto the General, he thought good to make stay of
her for the service, meaning to pay for her, as also accord-
ingly he performed at our return3 which bark was called
the Drake. The rest of these ships, being eight or nine,
were dismissed without anything at all taken from them.
Who being afterwards put somewhat farther off from the
“ shore, by the contrariety of the wind, we happened to meet
with some other French ships, full laden with N ewland fish,
being upon their return homeward from the said Newfound—
land,· whom the General after some speech had with them,
and seeing plainly that they were Frenchmen‚ dismissed,
without once suffering any man to go aboard of them.
