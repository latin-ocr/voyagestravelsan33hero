GERMANY 119

recreation abound. They go not to war; they touch no
arms; fast laid up is every hostile weap0n; peace and re-
pose are then only known, then only beloved, till to the
temple the same priest reconducts the Goddess when well
tired with the conversation of mortal beings. Anon the
chariot is washed and purified in a secret lake, as also the
curtains3 nay, the Deity herself too, if you choose to believe
it. In this office it is slaves who minister, and they are
forthwith doomed to be swallowed up in the same lake.
Hence all men are possessed with mysterious terror; as well
as with a holy ignorance what that must be, which none see
but such as are immediately to perish. Moreover this quar-
ter of the Suevians stretches to the middle of Germany.

The community next adjoining, is that of the Hermondu-
rial-153 (that I may now follow 'the course of the Danube,
as a little before Ι did that of the Rhine) a people this,

we only hear it named.

Close by the Hermondurians reside the Nariscans, and
next to them the Marcomanians and Quadians. Amongst
these the Marcomanians are most signal in force and re-

bravery, as from thence they formerly expulsed the Boians.
Nor do the Nariscans or Quadians degenerate in spirit.
Now this is as it were the frontier of Germany, as far as
Germany is washed by the Danube. To the times within
our memory the Marcomanians and Quadians were governed
by kings, who were natives of their own, descended from
the noble line of Maroboduus and Tudrus. At present they
are even subject to such as are foreigners. But the whole
strength and sway of their kings is derived from the au-
