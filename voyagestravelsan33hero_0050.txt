this there is a sacred story told.

Besides these things the Egyptians have found out also to
what god each month and each day belongs, and what
fortunes a man will meet with who is born on any particular
day, and how he will die, and what kind of a man he will be:
and these inventions were taken up by those of the Hellenes
who occupied themselves about poesy. Portents too have been
found out by them more than by all other men besides; for
when a portent has happened, they observe and write down
the event which comes of it, and if ever afterwards anything
resembling this happens, they believe that the event which
comes of it will be similar. Their divination is ordered

mud. Then leaving the corpse within the house they go
themselves to and fro about the city and beat themselves,
with their garments bound up by a girdle and their breasts
exposed, and with them go all the women who are related to
the dead man, and on the other side the men beat themselves,
they too having their garments bound up by a girdle; and
when they have done this, they then convey the body to the
embalming. In this occupation certain persons employ them-
selves regularly and inherit this as a craft. These, whenever
