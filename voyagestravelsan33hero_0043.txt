EGYPT 35

in a small shrine of wood covered over with gold, they take
out on the day before to another sacred building. The few
then who have been left about the image, draw a wain with
four wheels, which bears the shrine and the image that is
within the shrine, and the other priests standing in the gate-
way try to prevent it from entering, and the men who are
under a vow come to the assistance of the god and strike
them, while the others defend themselves. Then there comes
to be a hard fight with staves, and they break one another's
heads, and I am of opinion that many even die of the wounds
they receive; the Egyptians however told me that no one
died. This solemn assembly the people of the place say that
they established ior the following reason z--the mother of
Ares, they say, used to dwell in this temple, and Ares, having
been brought up away from her, when he grew up came
thither desiring to visit his mother, and the attendants of
his mother's temple, not having seen him before, did not
permit him to pass in, but kept him away; and he brought
men to help him from another city and handled roughly the
attendants of the temple, and entered to visit his mother.
Hence, they say, this exchange of blows has become the
custom in honour ot' Ares upon his festival.

The Egyptians were the first who made it a point of reli—
gion not to lie with women in temples, nor to enter into
temples after going away from women without first bathing:
for almost all other men except the Egyptians and the Hel-
lenes lie with women in temples and enter into a temple after
going away t'rom women without bathing, since they hold
that there is no difference in this respect between men and
beasts: for they say that they see beasts and the various
kinds of birds coupling together both in the temples and in
the sacred enclosures of the gods; if then this were not
pleasing to the god, the beasts would not do so.

Thus do these defend that which they do, which by me
is disallowed: but the Egyptians are excessively careful in
their observances‚ both in other matters which concern the
sacred rites and also in those which follow z—Egypt, though
it borders upon Libya, does not very much abound in wild
animals‚ but such as they have are one and all accounted by
them sacred, some of them living with men and others not.
