EGYPT 47

retreating waters ; and when the time comes round again‚and
the water once more comes over the land, from these eggs
forthwith are produced the fishes of which Ι speak.

Thus it is as regards the fish. And for anointing those
of the Egyptians who dwell in the fens use oil from the
castor-berry, which oil the Egyptians call leiki, and thus they
do :-they sow along the banks of the rivers and pools
these plants‚ which in a wild form grow of themselves in the
land of the Hellenes; these are sown in Egypt and produce
berries in great quantity but of an evil smell; and when they
have gathered these, some cut them up and press the oil
from them, others again roast them first and then boil them
down and collect that which runs away from them. The oil
is fat and not less suitable for burning than olive-oil, but it
gives forth a disagreeable smell. Against the gnats, which
are very abundant, they have contrived as follows t—tliose
who dwell above the fen-land are helped by the towers, to
which they ascend when they go to rest; for the gnats by
reason of the winds are not able to fly up high: but those
who dwell in the fen-land have contrived another way in-
stead of the towers‚ and this it is z——every man of them has
got a casting net, with which by day he catches fish, but in
the night he uses it for this purpose, that is to say he puts
the casting-net round about the bed in which he sleeps‚ and
then creeps in under it and goes to sleep: and the gnats, if he
sleeps rolled up in a garment or a linen sheet, bite through
these, but through the net they do not even attempt to bite.

Their boats with which they carry cargoes are made of
the thorny acacia, of which the form is very like that of the
Kyrenian lotos, and that which exudes from it is gum. From
this tree they eut pieces of wood about two cubits in length
and arrange them like bricks, fastening the boat together by
running a great number of long bolts through the two-cubit
pieces; and when they have thus fastened the boat together,
they lay eross-pieces over the top, using no ribs for the
sides; and within they caulk the seams with papyrus. They
make one steering-oar for it, which is passed through the
bottorn of the boat; and they have a mast of acacia and sails
of papyrus. These boats cannot sail up the river unless
there be a very fresh wind blowing, but are towed from the
