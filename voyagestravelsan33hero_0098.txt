90 HERODOTUS

Moreover Amasis became a lover of the Hellenes; and
besides other proofs of friendship which he gave to several
among them, he also granted the city of Naucratis for those
of them who came to Egypt to dwell in; and to those who
did not desire to stay, but who made voyages thither, he
granted portions of land to set up altars and make sacred
enclosures for their gods. Their greatest enclosure and
that one which has most name and is most frequented is
called the Hellenion, and this was established by the follow-
ing cities in common z—of the Ionians Chios, Teos, Phocaia,
Clazomenai, of the Dorians Rhodes, Cnidos, Halicarnassos,
Phaselis, and of the Aiolians Mytilene alone. To these be-
longs this enclosure and these are the eities which appoint
superintendents of the port; and all other cities which claim

a share in it, are making a claim without any right. Besides ,

when the Amphictyons had let out the contract for building
the temple which now exists at Delphi, agreeing to pay a sum
of three hundred talents (for the temple which formerly stood
there had been burnt down of itself), it fell to the share of
the people of Delphi to provide the fourth part of the pay-
ment3 and accordingly the Delphians went about to various
cities and collected contributions. And when they did this they
got from Egypt as much as from any place, for Amasis gave
them a thousand talents’ weight of alum, while the Hellenes
who dwelt in Egypt gave them twenty pounds of silver.
Also with the people of Kyrene Amasis made an agree-
ment for friendship and allianee; and he resolved too to
marry a wife from thence, whether because he desired to
have a wife of Hellenic race, or, apart from that, on ace
