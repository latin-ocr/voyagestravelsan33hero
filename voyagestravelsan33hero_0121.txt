GERMANY 1 13

impatience3 how to employ the day, how to entrench them-
selves by night. They account fortune amongst things
slippery and uncertain, but bravery amongst such as are
never-{ailing and secure3 and, what is exceeding rare nor
ever to be learnt but by a wholesome course of discipline, in
the conduct of the general they repose more assurance than
in the strength of the army. Their whole forces consist of
foot, who besides their arms carry likewise instruments of
iron and their provisions. You may see other Germans
proceed equipped to battle, but the Cattans so as to conduct
a war.²⁰ They rarely venture upon excursions or casual
eneounters. It is in truth peculiar to cavalry, suddenly to
conquer‚ or suddenly to fly. Such haste and velocity rather

and duty contracted by their birth, and rendered themselves
worthy of their country, worthy of their parents. Upon the
spiritless‚ cowardly and unwarlike, such deformity of visage
still remains.²¹ All the most brave likewise wear an iron
ring (a mark of great dishonour this in that nation) and
retain it as a chain; till by killing an enemy they become re-
leased. Many of the Cattans delight always to bear this
terrible aspect; and, when grown white through age, become
awful and conspicuous by such marks, both to the enemy and
their own countrymen. By thern in all engagements the first
assault is made: of them the front ot* the battle is always
composed, as men who in their looks are singular and tre-
mendous. For even during peace they abate nothing in the
grimness and horror of their countenance. They have no
