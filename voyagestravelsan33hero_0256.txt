248 DRAKE’S FAMOUS VOYAGE

wards of glass, coloured beads, and other things, which we
had found at Santi090; wherewsth, as it seemed, they tested
very greatly satisfied, and shewed some sorrowful counte-
nance when they perceived that we would depart.

From hence we went to another island westward of it,
called Saint Clzristoplzer’s Island; wherein we spent some
