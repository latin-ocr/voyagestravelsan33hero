832 SIR WALTER RALEIGH

he carne to the palace of Iuga. After that Martinez had
lived seven months in Manoa, and began to understand the
language of the country, I nga asked him whether he desired
to return into his own country, or would willingly abide with
him. But M artinez, not desirous to stay, obtained the favour
of Iuga to depart; with whom he sent divers Guiam'ans to
conduct him to the river of Orenoqzte, all loaden with as
much gold as they could carry, which he gave to Martinez
at his departure. But when he was arrived near the river's
side, the borderers which are called Ονεηοιῑιιεροηῐ17 robbed
him and his Gzcianians of all the treasure (the borderers
being at that time at wars, which Iuga had not conquered)
save only of two great bottles of gourds, which were filled
with beads of gold curiously wrought‚ which those Orenoque-
poni thought had been no other thing than his drink or meat,
or grain for food, with which Martinez had liberty to pass.
And so in canoas he fell down from the river of Orenoque
to Trinidad, and from thence to M argarita; and so to S t. J uan
de Puerto Rico‚· where, remaining a long time for passage
into Spain, he died. In the time of his extreme sickness,
and when he was without hope of life, receiving the sacra-
ment at the hands of his confessor, he delivered these things,
with the relation of his travels, and also called for his
calabazas or gourds of the gold beads, which he gave to the
church and sriars, to be prayed for.

This Martinez was he that christened the city of Manoa
by the name of El Dorado, and, as Berreo informed me,
upon this occasion, those Guianians, and also the borderers,
and all other in that tract which Ι have seen, are marvellous
great drunkards3 in which vice I think no nation can com-
pare with thern; and at the times of their solemn feasts,
when the emperor carouseth with his captains, tributaries,
and governors, the manner is thus. All those that pledge him
are first stripped naked and their bodies anointed all over
with a kind of white balsamum (by them called curca), of
which there is great plenty, and yet very dear amongst
them, and it is of all other the most precious, whereof we
have had good experience. When they are anointed all over,
certain servants os: the emperor, having prepared gold made
