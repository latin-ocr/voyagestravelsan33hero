76 HERODOTUS

rinth surpasses even the pyramids. It has twelve courts
covered in, with gates facing one another, six upon the
North side and six upon the South‚ joining on one to an-
other, and the same wall surrounds them all outside; and
there are in it two -kinds os chambers, the one kind below
the ground and the other above upon these, three thousand
in number, of each kind fifteen hundred. The upper set οἱ
chambers we ourselves saw, going through them, and we tell
of them having looked upon them with our own eyes; but
the chambers under ground we heard about only; for the
Egyptians who had charge of them were not willing on any
account to show them, saying that here were the sepulchres
of the kings who had first built this labyrinth and of the
sacred crocodileS. Accordingly we speak of the chambers
below by what we received from hearsay, while those above
we saw ourselves and found them to be works of more than
human greatness. For the passages through the chambers,
and the goings this way and that way through the courts,
which were admirably adorned, afforded endless matter for
marvel, as we went through from a court to the chambers
beyond it, and from the chambers to colonnades, and from
the colonnades to other rooms, and then from the chambers
again to other courts. Over the whole of these is a roos
made of stone like the walls 3 and the walls are covered
with figures carved upon them, each court being surrounded
with pillars of white stone fitted together most perfectly;
and at the end of the labyrinth, by the corner of it, there is
a pyramid of forty fathoms, upon which large figures are
carved, and to this there is a way made under ground.

Such is this labyrinth: but a cause for marvel even greater
than this is afforded by the lake, which is called the lake of
Moiris, along the side of which this labyrinth is built. The
measure of its circuit is three thousand six hundred furlongs
(being sixty semines), and this is the same number of fur-
longs as the extent of Egypt itselt' along the sea. The lake
lies extended lengthwise from North to South, and in depth
where it is deepest it is fifty fathoms. That this lake is
artificial and formed by digging is self·evident‚ sor about
in the middle of the lake stand two pyramids, each rising
above the water to a height ot fifty fathoms, the part which
