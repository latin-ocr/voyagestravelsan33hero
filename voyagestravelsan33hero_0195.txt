THIRD VOYAGE 187

rather, that the want of shoes might be supplied by means
of the Cimaroons, who were a great help unto us: all our
men complaining of the tenderness of their feet, whom our
Captain would himself accompany in their complaint, some
times without cause, but some times with cause indeed;
which made the rest to bear the burden the more easily.

These Cimaroons, during all the time that we were with
burden, did us continually very good service, and in par-
ticular in this Journey, being unto us instead of intelligen- ,
cers, to advertise us; of guides in our way to direct us;
of purveyors, to provide victuals for us: of house-wrights to
build our lodgings; and had indeed able and strong bodies
carrying all our necessaries: yea, many times when some
of our company fainted with sickness of weariness, two
Cimaroons would carry him with ease between them, two
miles together, and at other times, when need was, they
would shew themselves no less valiant than industrious,
and of good judgment.

From this town, at our first entrance in the evening, on
Saturday (22nd February), our Captain despatched a Cim-
aroon with a token and certain order to the Master: who
had, these three weeks, kept good watch against the enemy,
and shifted in the woods for fresh victual, for the relies
and recovery of our men left aboard.

As soon as this messenger was come to the shore, calling
to our ship, as bringing some neWS‚ he was quickly fet[ched]
aboard by those which longed to hear of our Captain's speed-
ing: but when he showed the toothpike of gold, which he
said our Captain had sent for a token to ELLIS H1xoM,
with charge to meet him at such a river though the Mas-
ter knew well the Captain's toothpike: yet by reason of
his admonition and caveat [warning] given him at part-
ing, he (though he bewrayed no sign of distrusting the
Cimaroon) yet stood as amazed, least something had be-
fallen our Captain otherwise than well. The Cimaroon
perceiving this, told him, that it was night when he was
sent away, so that our Captain could not send any letter,
but yet with the point of his knife, he wrote something
upon the toothpick, “which,'’ he said, “should be sufficient
to gain credit to the messenger.’'
