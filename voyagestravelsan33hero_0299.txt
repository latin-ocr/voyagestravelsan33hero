TO N EWFOUNDLAND 291

having their descents‚ the valleys also and low grounds must
be likewise hot or temperate, as the clime doth give in N ew-
foundland: though I am of opinion that the sun’s reflection
is much cooled, and cannot be so forcible in Newfozmdland, ,
nor generally throughout America‚ as in Europe or Afric:
by how much the sun in his diurnal course from east to west,
passeth over, for the most part, dry land and sandy coun-
tries, before he arriveth at the west of Europe or Afric,
whereby his motion increaseth heat, with little or no quali-
fication by moist vapours. Where[as], on the contrary, he
passeth from Europe and Afric unto America over the
ocean, from whence he draweth and carrieth with him
abundance of moist vapours, which do qualify and enfeeble
greatly the sun's reverberation upon this country chiefly of
Newfoundland, being so much to the northward. Never—
theless, as I said before, the cold cannot be so intolerable
under the latitude of 46, 47, and 48, especial within land, that
it should be unhabitable‚ as some do suppose, seeing also
there are very many people more to the north by a great deal.
And in these south parts there be certain beasts, ounces or
leopards‚ and birds in like manner, which in the summer we
have seen, not heard of in countries of extreme and vehe-
ment coldness. Besides, as in the months of June, July,
August and September, the heat is somewhat more than in
England at those seasons: so men remaining upon the south
parts near unto Cape Race, until after bolland—tide,⁷ have
not found the cold so extreme, nor much differing from the
temperature of England. Those which have arrived there
after November and December have found the snow exceed-
ing deep, whereat no marvel, considering the ground upon
the coast is rough and uneven, and the snow is driven into
the places most declining‚ as the like is to be seen with us.
The like depth of snow happily shall not be found within
land upon the plainer countries, which also are defended by
the mountains‚ breaking off the violence of winds and
Weather. But admitting extraordinary cold in those south
parts, above that with us here, it cannot be so great as in
Swedeland, much less in Moscovia or Russia: yet are the
same countries very populous, and the rigour of cold is dis-

'1 All-hallow—tide (November 1).
