DISCOVERY OF GUIANA 341

with them; and more, to his disadvantage, the caciques and
kings of Amapaia had given knowledge of his purpose to the
Guianians, and that he sought to sack and conquer the em-
pire, for the hope of their so great abundance and quantities
of gold. He passed by the mouths οἱ many great rivers
which fell into Orenoque both from the north and south,
which Ι forbear to name, for tediousness, and because they
are more pleasing in describing than reading.

Berreo affirmed that there fell an hundred rivers into
Orenoque from the north and south: whereof the least was
as big as Rio Grande‚²³ that passed between Popayan and
Nuevo Reyno de Granada, Rio Grande being esteemed one
of the renowned rivers in all the West Indies, and num-
bered among the great rivers of the world. But he knew
not the names of any of these, but Caroli only; neither from
what nations they descended, neither to what provinces they
led, for he had no means to discourse with the inhabitants
at any tin1e; neither was he curious in these things, being
utterly unlearned, and not knowing the east from the west.
But of all these Ι got some knowledge, and of many more,
partly by mine own travel, and the rest by conference; of
some one I learned one, of others the rest, having with me
an Indian that spake many languages, and that of Guiana²⁹
naturally. Ι sought out all the aged men, and such as were
greatest travellers. And by the one and the other I came
to understand the situations, the rivers, the kingdoms from
the east sea to the borders of Peru, and from Orenoque south-
ward as far as Amazons or Μαναῆονι, and the regions of
Marinatambal,³⁰ and of all the kings of provinces, and cap-
tains of towns and villages, how they stood in terms ot'
peace or war, and which were friends or enemies the one
with the other: without which there can be neither entrance
nor conquest in those parts, nor elsewhere. For by the
dissension between Guascar and Atabalipa, Pisarro con-
quered Peru, and by the hatred that the Tlaxcallians bare
to Mutezuma, Cortes was victorious over Mexz'co‚· without
which both the one and the other had failed of their enter-
prise, and of the great honour and riches which they at-
tained unto.
