274 GILBERT’S VOYAGE

religious and valiant in armS, endeavouring to bring those
northerly regions also under the Spanish jurisdiction, as if
God had prescribed limits unto the Spanish nation which
they might not exceed; as by their own gests recorded may
be aptly gathered.

The French, as they can pretend less title unto these
northern parts than the Spaniard, by how much the
Spaniard made the first discovery of the same continent so
far northward as unto Florida, and the French did but re-
view that before discovered by the English nation, usurping
upon our right, and imposing names upon countries, rivers,
bays, capes, or headlands as if they had been the first finders
of those coasts; which injury we offered not unto the
Spaniards, but left off to discover when we approached the
Spanish limits: even so God hath not hitherto permitted
them to establish a possession permanent upon another’s
right, notwithstanding their manifold attempts, in which the
issue hath been no less tragica] than that of the Spaniards,
as by their own reports is extant.

Then‚ seeing the English nation only hath right unto these
countries of America from the Cape of Florida northward
by the privilege of first discovery, unto which Cabot was
authorised by regal authority, and set forth by the expense
of our late famous King Henry the Seventh; which right
also seemeth strongly defended on our behalf by the power-
ful hand of Almighty God withstanding the enterprises of
other nations; it may greatly encourage us upon so just
ground, as is our right, and upon so sacred an intent, as
to plant religion (our right and intent being meet founda-
tions for the same), to prosecute effectually the full posses-
sion οἱ those so ample and pleasant countries appertaining
unto the crown of England; the same, as is to be conjectured
by infallible arguments of the world's end approaching, being
now arrived unto the time by God prescribed of their voca-
tion, if ever their calling unto the knowledge of God may
be expected. Which also is very probable by the revolution
and course of God’s word and religion, which from the be·
ginning hath moved from the east towards, and at last unto„
the west, where it is like to end, unless the same begin again
where it did in the east, which were to expect a like world
