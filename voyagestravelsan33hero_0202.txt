194 SIR FRANCIS DRAKE

time when it should take beginning, and the place where we
should meet, namely, at Rio Francisco.

Having thus agreed with Captain ΤΕΤῦ, we sent for the
Cimaroons as before was decreed. Two of them were
brought aboard our ships, to give the French assurance of
this agreement.

And as soon as we could furnish ourselves and refresh
the French company, which was within five or six days
(by bringing them to the magazines which were the nearest,
where they were supplied by us in such sort, as they pro-
tested they were beholding to us for all their lives) taking
twenty of the French and fifteen of ours with our OEmaroons,
leaving both our ships in safe road‚ we manned our frigate
and two pinnaces (we had formerly sunk our Lion, shortly
after our return from Panama, because we had not men suf-
ficient to man her), and went towards Rio Francisco: which
because it had not water enough for our frigate, caused us
to leave her at the Cabecas, manned with English and
French‚ in the charge of Romam DOBLE, to stay there without
attempting any chase, until the return of our pinnaces.

And then bore to Rio FranciscO, where both Captains
landed ⁴(31st March) with such force as aforesaid [i.e., 20
French‚ 15 English, and the Cimaroons]‚ and charged them
that had the charge of the pinnaces to be there the fourth
day next following without any fail. And thus knowing
that the carriages [mule loads] went now daily from Pan-
ama to Nombre de Dios; we proceeded in covert through
the woods, towards the highway that leadeth between them.

It is five leagues accounted by sea, between Rio Francisco
and Nombre de Dios; but that way which we march by land,
we found it above seven leagues. We marched as in our
former journey to Panama, both for order and silence; to
the great wonder of the French Captain and company, who
protested they knew not by any means how to recover the
pinnaces, if the Cimaroons (to whom what our Captain
commanded was a law; though they little regarded the
French‚ as having no trust in thern) should leave us: our
Captain assured him, “There was no cause of doubt of
them, of whom he had had such former trial.’'
