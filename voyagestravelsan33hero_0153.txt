THIRD VOYAGE 14⁵

the strength of the Market Place‚ till they had despatched
the business for which they carne.

But as he stepped forward, his strength and sight and
speech failed him, and he began to faint for want of blood,
which, as then we perceived, had, in great quantity, issued
upon the sand, out of a wound received in his leg in the
first encounter, whereby though he felt some pain, yet
(for that he perceived divers of the company, having al-
ready gotten many good things, to be very ready to take
all occasions, of winding themselves out of that conceited
danger) would he not have it known to any, till this his
sainting, against his will, bewrayed it: the blood having

And therefore even they, which were willing to have

of him, that while they enjoyed his presence, and had him
to command them, they might recover wealth sufficient; but
if once they lost him, they should hardly be able to recover
home. No, not with that which they had gotten already.

Thus we embarked by break of the day (29th July),
having besides our Captain, many of our men wounded,
