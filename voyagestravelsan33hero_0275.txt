ROUND THE WORLD ²67

Notwithstanding, after all this, the General offered them,
with consent of his captains, another ship with some pro-

visions, although not such a one for their turns as might Ι

have been spared them before, this being unable to be
brought into their harbour: or else, if they would, to give
them passage into England, although he knew he should per-

the single share. We lost some 750 men in the voyage;
