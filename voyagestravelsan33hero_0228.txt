220 DRAKE’S FAMOUS VOYAGE

John Drake, going up into the top, descried her about three
of the clock. And about six of the clock we came to her
and boarded her, and shot at her three pieces of ordnance‚
and strake down her mizen; and, being entered, we found
in her great riches, as jewels and precious stones‚ thirteen
chests full of reals of plate, fourscore pound weight of gold,
and six—and—twenty ton of silver. The place where we took
this prize was called Cape de San Francisco, about 150
leagues [south] from Panama. The pilot’s name of this
ship was Francisco,· and amongst other plate that our
General found in this ship he found two very fair gilt bowls
of silver, which were the pilofs. To whom our General
said, Sefior Pilot, you have here two silver cups, but I must
needs have one of them· which the pilot, because he could
not otherwise choose‚ yielded unt0, and gave the other to the
steward of our General's ships. When this pilot departed
from us, his boy said thus unto our General: Captain‚ our
ship shall be called no more the Cacafuego, but the Caea-
plata, and your ship shall be called the Cacafuego. Which
pretty speech of the pilot’s boy ministered matter of laughter
to uS, both then and long after. When our General had done
what he would with this CacafuegO, he cast her off, and we
went on our course still towards the west; and not long after
met with a ship laden with linen eloth and fine China dishes
of white earth, and great store of Clzina silks, of all which
things we took as we listed. The owner himself of this ship
was in her, who was a Spanish gentleman,u from whom our
General took a falcon of gold, with a great emerald in the
breast thereos ;¹2 and the pilot of the ship he took aIso with
him, and so cast the ship off.

This pilot brought us to the haven of Guatulco, the town
whereof, as he told us, had but 17 Spaniards in it. As soon
as we were entered this haven, we landed, and went presently
to the town and to the town-house; where we found a judge
sitting in judgment‚ being associated with three other offi-
cer5‚ upon three negroes that had conspired the burning
of the town. Both which judges and prisoners we took,
and brought them a-shipboard‚ and caused the chief judge ⁸
