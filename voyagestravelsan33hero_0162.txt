154 SIR FRANCIS DRAKE

every other day interchangeable; the other half being en-
joined to the necessary works, about our ship and pin-
naces, and the providing of fresh victuals, fish, fowl, hogs,
deer, conies, δια, whereof there is great plenty. Here our
smiths set up their forge, as they used, being furnished out
of England, with anvil, iron, coals‚ and all manner of nec·
essaries, which stood us in great stead.

At the end of these fifteen days (5th September), our

from the mouth of it, filled fresh water for our beverage.

From three o'clock till dark at night, we rowed up the
stream; but the current was so strong downwards‚ that we
got but two leagues, all that time. We moored our pinnaces
to a tree that night: for that presently, with the closing of
the evening, there fell a monstrous shower of rain, with
