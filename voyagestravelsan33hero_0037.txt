EGYPT 29

sacrifice swine; but to the Moon and to Dionysos alone at
the same time and on the same full-moon they sacrifice
swine, and then eat their flesh: and as to the reason why,
when they abominate swine at all their other feasts‚ they
sacrifice them at this, there is a story told by the Egyptians;
and this story I know, but it is not a seemly one for me to
tell. Now the sacrifice of the swine to the Moon is per-
formed as follows 1—when the priest has slain the victim,
he puts together the end ot* the tail and the spleen and the
caul, and covers them up with the whole of the fat of the
animal which is about the paunch, and then he offers them
with fire; and the rest of the flesh they eat on that day of
full moon upon which they have held the sacrifice, but on
any day after this they will not taste of it: the poor how-
ever among them by reason of the scantiness of their means
shape pigs of dough and having baked them they offer these
as a sacrifice. Then for Dionysos on the eve of the festival
each one kills a pig by cutting its throat before his own
doors, and after that he gives the pig to the swineherd
who sold it to him, to carry away again; and the rest of the
feast of Dionysos is celebrated by the Egyptians in the same
way as by the Hellenes in almost all things except choral
dances, but instead of the phallos they have invented an-
other contrivance, namely figures of about a cubit in height
worked by strings‚ which women carry about the villages,
with the privy member made to move and not much less in
size than the rest of the body: and a flute goes before and
they follow singing the praises of Dionysos. As to the
reason why the figure has this member larger than is natural
and moves it, though it moves-no other part of the body,
about this there is a sacred story told. Now 1 think that
Melampus the son of Amytheon was not without knowledge
of these rites of sacrifice, but was acquainted with them: for
Melampus is he who first set forth to the Hellenes the name
of Dionysos and the manner of sacrifice and the procession
of the phallos. Strictly speaking indeed, he when he made
it known did not take in the whole, but those wise men who
came after him made it known more at large. Melampus
then is he who taught of the phallos which is carried in pro-
cession for Dionysos, and from him the Hellenes learnt to
