334 SIR WALTER RALEIGH

finding by the said river any passage into Guiana, nor any
possibility to return towards Peru by the same Amazons, by
reason that the descent of the river made so great a current,
he was enforced to disemboque at the mouth of the said
Amazons, which cannot be less than 1‚ooo leagues from the
place where they embarked. From thence he coasted the
land till he arrived at Margarita to the north of M ompatar
which is at this day called Puerto de Tyranno, for that he
there slew Don suan de Villa Andreda‚G0ve1-n0r of Marga-
rita, who was father to Don Juan Sarmiento, Governor of
Margarita when Sir J olm Bm gh landed there and attempted
the island. Α guirre put to the sword all other in the island
that refused to be of his party, and took with him certain
cimarrones21 and other desperate companions. From thence
he went to Cumana and there slew the governor, and dealt
in all as at Margarita. He spoiled all the coast of Caracas
and the province of Venezuela and of Rio de Za Hacha; and,
as I remember, it was the same year that Sir John Hawkins
sailed to St. suan de Ullua in the Iesus of Lubeck;²⁹ for
himself told me that he met with such a one upon the coast,
that rebelled, and had sailed down all the river of Amazons.
Aguirre from thence landed about Sama Marta and sacked
it also, putting to death so many as refused to be his fol-
lowers, purposing to invade N nevo Reyno de Granada and to
sack Pamplona, M erida, Lagrita, Tunja, and the rest of the
cities of Nuevo Reyno, and from thence again to enter Peru ,·
but in a fight in the said Nuevo Reyno he was overthrown,
and, finding no way to escape, he first put to the sword his
own children, foretelling them that they should not live to be
defamed or upbraided by the Spaniards after his death, who
would have termed them the children of a traitor or tyrant3
and that, sithence he could not make them princes, he would
yet deliver them from shame and reproach. These were the
ends and tragedies of Ordas, Martinez, Orellana, Orsua, and
Aguirre. Also soon after Ordas followed Ieronimo Ortal
de Saragosa‚ with 130 soldiers; who failing his entrance by
sea, was cast with the current on the coast of Paria, and
peopled about S. Miguel de Neveri. It was then attempted
by Don Pedro de Silva, a Portuguese of the family of Ruy
