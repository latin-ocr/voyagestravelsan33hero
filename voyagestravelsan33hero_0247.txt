ROUN D THE WORLD 239

descried another tall ship of twelve score tons or thereabouts‚
upon whom Master Carme, the Lieutenant—General, being in
the Tiyer, undertook the chase; whom also anon after the
Admiral followed. And the Tiyer having caused the said
strange ship to strike her sails, kept her there without suffer-
¹„ing anybody to go aboard until the Admiral was come up;
vwho forthwith sending for the master, and divers others of
their principal men, and causing them to be severally exam—
ined, found the ship and goods to be belonging to the inhabi-
tants of St. Sebastiam in Spain, but the mariners to be for
the most part belonging to St. John de Luz, and the Pas-
Saye? In this ship was great store of dry Newland fish‚
commonly called with us Poor J012n; whereof afterwards,
being thus found a lawful prize, there was distribution made
into all the ships of the fleet‚ the same being so new and good,

to be manned, and every man to be furnished with such arms
as were needful for that present service; which being done,
the General put himself into his galley, which was also well
furnished‚ and rowing towards the city of Bayon, with in-
tent, and the favour of the Almighty, to surprise it. Before
we had advanced one half-league of our way there came a
messenger‚ being an English merchant, from the governor,
to see what strange fleet we were; who carne to our General,
conferred a while with him, and after a small time spent,
our General called for Captain Sampson, and willed him to
go to the governor of the city, to resolve him of two points.
Ι The first to know if there were any wars between Spain and

Enyland; the second, why our merchants with their qoods
were embaryed or arrested? Thus departed Captain Samp‘-
son with the said messenger to the city, where he found the
governor and people much amazed of such a sudden accident.
The General, with the advice and counsel of Master Carlile,
his Lieutenant-General‚ who was in the galley with him,
