DISCOVERY OF GUIANA 371

found loose on the ground, and were for the most part but
coloured, and had not any gold fixed in them. Yet such
as had no judgment or experience kept all that glistered‚
and would not be persuaded but it was rich because of
the lustre; and brought of those, and of marcasite wsthal,
from Trinidad, and have delivered of those stones to be
tried in many placeS, and have thereby bred an opinion
that all the rest is of the same. Yet some of these stones
Ι shewed afterward to a Spaniard of the Caracas, who told
me that it waS El madre del oro, that is, the mother of gold,
and that the mine was farther in the ground.

But it shall be found a weak policy in me, either to betray
myself or my country with imaginations; neither am I
so far in love with that lodging, watching‚ care, peril,

On the left hand of this river Caroli are seated those
nations which I called Iwarawaqueri before remembered,
which are enemies to the Epuremei; and on the head of it,
adjoining to the great lake Cassipa‚ are situated those other
nations which also resist Iuga, and the Epitremei, called
Cassipagows, Eparegotos, and Arawagotos. Ι farther under-
stood that this lake of σπεῖρα is so large, as it is above
one day’s journey for one of their canoas, to crOSS‚ which
may be some forty miles; and that thereinto fall divers
rivers, and that great store of grains of gold are found in ·
the summer time when the lake falleth by the banks, in
those branches.

There is also another goodly river beyond Caroli which
