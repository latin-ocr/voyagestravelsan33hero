376 SIR WALTER RALEIGH

such an enterprise. And if I did, I was sure with all my
company to be buried there, for the emperor was of that
strength, as that many times so many men more were too
few. Besides, he gave me this good counsel and advised
me to hold it in mind (as for himself, he knew he could not
live till my return), that I should not offer by any means
hereafter to invade the strong parts of Gaiana without the
help of all those nations which were also their enemies; for
that it was impossible without those, either to be conducted,
to be victualled, or to have aught carried with us, our people
not being able to endure the march in so great heat and
travail, unless the borderers gave them help, to cart with
them both their meat and furniture. For he remembered
that in the plains of Macureguarai three hundred Spaniards
were overthrown‚ who were tired out, and had none of the
borderers to their friends ; but meeting their enemies as they

fishes. I asked him whether he thought that those com-
panies that I had there with me were sufficient to take that
’ town or n0; he told me that he thought they were. I then
asked him whether he would assist me with guides, and some
companies of his people to join with us3 he answered that
he would go himself with all the borderers, if the rivers did
remain fordable, upon this condition, that Ι would leave with
ς him till my return again fifty soldiers, which he undertook
to victual. I answered that Ι had not above fifty good men
in all there; the rest were labourers and rowers, and that I
had no provision to leave with them of powder, shot‚ ap-
parel, or aught else, and that without those things necessary
