174 SIR FRANCIS DRAKE

travelled through these woodS, or they daily built very
readily for us in this manner.

As soon as we came to the place where we intended to
lodge, the Cimaroons, presently laying down their burdens,
fell to cutting of forks or posts, and poles or rafters, and
palmito boughs, or plantain leaves; and with great speed set
up to the number of six houses. For every of which, they
first fastened deep into the ground, three or four great posts
with forks: upon them, they laid one transom, which was
commonly about twenty feet, and made the sides, in the
manner of the roofs of our country houses, thatching it
close with those aforesaid leaves, which keep out water a
long time: observing always that in the lower ground, where
greater heat was, they left some three or four feet open
unthatched below, and made the houses, or rather roofs,
so many feet the higher. But in the hills, where the air
was more piercing and the nights cold, they made our rooms
always lower, and thatched them close to the ground, leav—
ing only one door to enter in, and a lover [louvre] hole for
a vent, in the midst of the roos. In every [one] of these,
they made four several lodgings, and three fires, one in the
midst‚ and one at each end of every house: so that the room
was most temperately warm, and nothing annoyed with
smoke, partly by reason of the nature of the wood which they
use to burn, yielding very little smoke, partly by reason of
their artificial making of it: as firing the wood cut in length
like ''our billets at the ends, and joining them together so
close, that though no flame or fire did appear, yet the heat
continued without intermission.

Near many of the rivers where we stayed or lodged, we
found sundry sorts of fruits, which we might use with great
pleasure and safety temperately: Mammas, Guayvas‚ Pal-
mitos, Pinos, Oranges, Lemons, and divers other ; from eating
of which, they dissuaded us ir. any case, unless we eat very
few of them, and those first dry roasted, as Plantains‚
Potat0[e] s, and such like.

In journeying‚ as oft as by chance they found any wild
swine, of which those hills and valleys have store, they would
ordinarily‚ six at a time, deliver their burdens to the rest of
their fellows, pursue, kill and bring away after us, as much
