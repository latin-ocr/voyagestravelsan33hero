ment, but in heat and rage, as they would an enemy, save
that no vengeance or penalty follows. The freedmen very
little surpass the slaves, rarely are of moment in the house;
in the community never, excepting only such nations where
arbitrary dominion prevails. For there they bear higher
sway than the free-born, nay, higher than the nobles. In
other countries the inferior condition of freedmen is a proof
of public liberty.

To the practice of usury and of increasing money by in-
terest, they are strangers; and hence is found a better guard
against it, than if it were forbidden. They shift from land
to land; and, still appropriating a portion suitable to the
number of hands for manuring, anon parcel out the whole
amongst particulars according to the condition and quality
of each. As the plains are very spaeious, the allotments are
easily assigned. Every year they change, and cultivate a
fresh soil; yet still there is ground to spare. For they strive
not to bestow labour proportionable to the fertility and com-
pass of their lands, by planting orchards‚ by enclosing mead-
ows, by watering gardens. From the earth, corn only is
exacted. Hence they quarter not the year into so many
seasons. Winter, Spring, and Summer, they understand;
and for each have proper appellations. Of the name and
blessings of Autumn, they are equally ignorant.

In performing their funerals, they show no state or vain-
glory. This only is carefully observed, that with the corpses
of their signal men certain woods be burned. Upon the
funeral pile they accumulate neither apparel nor perfumes.
Into the fire, are always thrown the arms of the dead, and
sometimes his horse. With sods of earth only the sepulchre
is raised. The pomp of tedious and elaborate monuments
they contemn, as things grievous to the deceased. Tears and
wailings they soon dismiss: their afflietion and woe they
long retain. In women, it is reckoned becoming to bewail
their loss; in men, to remember it. This is what in general
we have learned, in the original and customs of the whole
people of Germany. I shall now deduce the institutions and
usages of the several people, as far as they vary one from
another; as also an account of what nations from thence
removed, to settle themselves in Gaul.
