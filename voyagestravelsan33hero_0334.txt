326 SIR WALTER RALEIGH

send the country of Guiana from their invasion and conquest.
I shewed thern her Majesty's picture, which they so admired
and honoured, as it had been easy to have brought them
idolatrous thereos. The like and a more large discourse Ι
made to the rest of the nations, both in my passing to
Guiana and to those of the borders‚ so as in that part of the
world her Majesty is very famous and admirable3 whom
they now call EZRABETA CASSIPUNA AQUEREWANA, which is
as much as ‘Elizabeth‚ the Great Princess, or Greatest
Commander.' This done, we left Puerto de los Espar‘zoles,
and returned to Curiapan, and having Berreo my prisoner,
Ι gathered from him as much of Guiana as he knew. This
Berreo is a gentleman well descended, and had long served
the Spanish king in Milan, Naples, the Low Countries, and
elsewhere, very valiant and liberal, and a gentleman of
great assuredness, and of a great heart. Ι used him ac-
cording to his estate and worth in all things I could, accord-

company, who else would never have been brought to at-
tempt the same. Of which 600 miles I passed 400, leaving
my ships so far from me at anchor in the sea, which was
more ot* desire to perform that discovery than of reason,
especially having such poor and weak vessels to trans·
port ourselves in. For in the bottom of an old galego which
I caused to be fashioned like a galley, and in one barge, two
wherries, and a ship-boat of the Lion’s Whelp, we carried
100 persons and their victuals for a month in the same, be-
ing all driven to lie in the rain and weather in the open air,
in the burning sun, and upon the hard boards, and to dress
our meat, and to carry all manner of furniture in them.
Wherewith they were so pestered and unsavoury, that what
with victuals being most fish‚ with the wet clothes of so
many men thrust together, and the heat of the sun, I will
