364 SIR WALTER RALEIGH

and that there inhabited four principal nations. The first
were the Sayma, the next Assawai, the third and greatest
the Wikiri, by whom Pedro Hernandez de Serpa, before
mentioned, was overthrown as he passed with 300 horse from
Cumana towards Orenoque in his enterprise of Guiana. The
fourth are called Arorczs, and are as black as negroes, but
have smooth hair; and these are very valiant, or rather
desperate, people, and have the most strong poison on their
arrows, and most dangerous, of all nationS, of which Ι will
speak sornewhat, being a digression not unnecessary.

There was nothing whereof Ι was more curious than to
find out the true remedies of these poisoned arrows. For
besides the mortality of the wound they make, the party shot
endureth the most insufferable torment in the world, and
abideth a most ugly and lamentable death, sometimes dying
stark mad, sometimes their bowels breaking out of their
bellies; which are presently discoloured as black as pitch,
and so unsavory as no man can endure to cure or to attend
them. And it is more strange to know that in all this time
there was never Spaniard, either by gift or torment, that
could attain to the true knowledge of the cure, although they
have martyred and put to invented torture I know not how
many of them. But everyone of these Indians know it not,
no, not one among thousands, but their soothsayers and
priests, who do conceal it, and only teach it but from the
father to the son.

Those medicines which are vulgar, and serve for the ordi-
nary poison, are made of the juice of a root called tupara‚·
the same also quencheth marvellously the heat of burning
severs, and healeth inward wounds and broken veins that
bleed within the body. But I was more beholding to the
Guianians than any other; for Antonio de Berreo told me
that he could never attain to the knowledge thereos, and yet
they taught me the best way of healing as well thereos as
of all other poisons. Some of the Spaniards have been
cured in ordinary wounds of the common poisoned arrows
with the juice of garlie. But this is a general rule for all
men that shall herear'ter travel the Indies where poisoned
arrows are used, that they must abstain from drink. For if
they take any liquor into their body, as they shall be mar-
