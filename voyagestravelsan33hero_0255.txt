places, as also in the Spital House (which building was only
appointed to be spared), the great discontentrnent and scorn
we took at this their refraining to come unto us, as also at
the rude manner of killing, and savage kind of handling the
dead body of one of our boys found by them straggling all
alone, from whom they had taken his head and heart, and
had straggled the other bowels about the place, in a most
brutish and beastly manner. In revenge whereof at our de-
parting we consumed with fire all the houses, as well in the
country which we saw, as in the town of Santiago.

From hence putting off to the West Indies, we were not
many days at sea but there began among our people such
mortality as in a few days there were dead above two or
three hundred men. And until some seven or eight days
after our coming from Santiagm there had not died any one
man of sickness in all the fleet. The sickness showed not his
infecfion, wherewith so many were strueken, until we were
departed thence; and then seized our people with extreme
hot burning and continual agues, whereof very few escaped

that we fell withal; the same being inhabited with savage
people‚ which go all naked, their skin coloured with some
painting of a reddish tawny, very personable and handsome
strong men, who do admit little conversation with the Span-

they had a Spaniard or twain prisoners with them. Neither
do I think that there is any safety for any of our nation,
or any other, to be within the limits of their commandment;
albeit they used us very kindly for those few hours of time
which we spent with them, helping our folks to fill and
carry on their bare shoulders fresh water from the river to
our ships’ boats‚ and fetching from their houses great store
of tabacco, as also a kind of bread which they fed on, called
cassavi, very white and savoury, made of the roots of
