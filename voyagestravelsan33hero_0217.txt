ROUND THE WORLD 209

and leaving here one of our little barks, called the Benedict,
we took with us one os theirs which they called canters,
being of the burden of 40 tons or thereabouts. All these
things being finished we departed this harbour the 22. of
January, carrying along with us one of the Portugal carvels,
which was bound to the islands of Cape Verde for salt,
whereof good store is made in one of those islands. The
master or pilot of that carvel did advertise our General
that upon one of those islands, called Muyo, there was
great store of dried calvatos? which a few inhabitants there
dwelling did yearly make ready for such of the king''s ships
as did there touch, being bound sor his country of Brazil
or elsewhere. We fell with this island the 27. of January‚
but the inhabitants would in no case traffic with us, being
thereos forbidden by the king’s edict. Yet the next day

Which appearing, we found the inhabitants to be fled3 but
the place, by reason that it was manured, we found to be
more fruitful than the other part, especially the valleys v
among the hills.

Here we gave ourselves a little refreshing, as by very ripe
and sweet grapeS, which the fruitfulness of the earth at
that season of the year yielded us3 and that season being
with us the depth of winter, it may seem strange that those
sruits were then there growing. But the reason thereos is
this, because they being between the tropic and the equi-
noctial, the sun passeth twice in the year through their
zenith over their heads, by means whereof they have two
summers; and being so near the heat of the line they never
lose the heat of the sun so much, but the fruits have their
increase and continuance in the midst of winter. The island
'is wonderfully¹ stored with goats and wild hensj and it hath
