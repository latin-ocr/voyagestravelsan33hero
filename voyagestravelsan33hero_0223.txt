ROUND THE WORLD 215

willed every man the next Sunday following to prepare him-
self the communion, as Christian brethren and friends ought
to do. Which was done in very reverent sort; and so with
good contentment every man went about his business.

The 17. day of August we departed the port of S t. Julian:
and the 20. day we fell with the Strait of Magellam going
into the South Sea; at the cape or headland whereof we
found the body of a dead man, whose flesh was clean con-
sumed. The 21. day we entered the Strait‚⁵ which we found
to have many turnings‚ and as it were shuttings—up‚ as if there
were no passage at all. By means whereof we had the wind
often against us; so that some of the fleet recovering a cape
or point of land, others should be forced to turn back again,
and to come to an anchor where they could. In this Strait
there be many fair harbonrs, with store of fresh water. But

no small danger. The land on both sides is very huge and
mountainous3 the lower mountains whereof, although they
be monstrous and wonderful to look upon for their height,
yet there are others which in height exceed them in a strange
manner, reaching themselves above their fellows so high,
that between thern did appear three regions of clouds.
These mountains are covered with snOW. At both the
southerly and easterly parts of the Strait there are islands,
among which the sea hath his indraught into the Straits‚
even as it hath in the main entrance of the frete.⁶ This
Strait is extreme cold, with frost and snow continually; the
trees seem to stoop with the burden of the weather‚ and yet
are green continually, and many good and sweet herbs
do very plentifully grow and increase under them. The
breadth of the Strait is in some places a league, in some
other places two leagues and three leagues, and in some
