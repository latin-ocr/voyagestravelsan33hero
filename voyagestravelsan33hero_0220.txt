212 - DRAKE’S FAMOUS VOYAGE

arise, to the casting away of ships and men, whereof, as it
is reported, there have been divers experiments.

The 7. day in a mighty great storm, both of lightning,
rain, and thunder‚ we lost the canter, which we called
the C hristopher. But the eleventh day after, by our General’s
great care in dispersing his ships, we found her agaim and
the place where we met our General called the Cape of Joy,
where every ship took in some water. Here we found a
good temperature and sweet air, a very fair and pleasant
country withan exceeding fruitful soil, where were great
store of large and mighty deer‚ but we came not to the sight
of any people3 but travelling further into the country we
perceived the footing of people in the clay ground, shewing
that they were rnen of great stature. Being returned to our
ships we weighed anchor, and ran somewhat further, and

at the least have laden all our ships, and the rest of the
islands are, as it were, laden with fowls, which is wonderful
to see, and they of divers sorts. It is a place very plentiful
of victuals, and hath in it no want of fresh water. Our
General, after certain days of his abode in this place, being
on shore in an island, the people of the country shewed
themselves unto hirn, leaping and dancing, ancl entered into
traffic with him3 but they would not receive anything at
any man's hands, but the same must be cast upon the ground.
They are of clean, comely, and strong bodies, swift on foot,
and seem to be very active.

The 18. day of May, our General thought it needful to
