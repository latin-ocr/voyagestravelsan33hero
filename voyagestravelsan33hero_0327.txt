DISCOVERY OF GUIANA 319

the affairs of the Spanish king now living, what territories he
hath purchased, what he hath added to the acts of his predeces-
sors, how many kingdoms he hath endangered, how many armies,
garrisons, and navies he hath, and doth maintain‚ the great losses
which he hath repaired, as in Eighty—eight above an hundred sail
of great ships with their attinet-y, and that no year is less in·
fortunate, but that many vessels, treasures, and people are de-
vomed, and yet notwithstanding he beginneth again like a storm
to threaten shipwrack to us all; we shall find that these abilities
rise not from the trades of sacks and Seville oranges, nor from
aught else that either Spain, Portuyal, or any of his other prov-
inces produce; it is his Indian gold that endangereth and dis-
turbeth all the nations of Europe,· it purchaseth intelligence,
creepeth into comsels, and setteth bound loyalty at liberty in the
greatest monarchies of Europe. If the Spanish king can keep
us from foreign enterprises‚ and from the impeachrnent of his
trades, either by offer of invasion, or by besieging us in Britain,
Ireland, or elsewhere, he hath then brought the work of our peril
in great forwardness.

Those princes that abound in treasure have great advantage,
over the rest, if they once constrain them to a defensive war,
where they are driven once a year or oftener to cast lots for
their own garments; and from all such shall all trades and inter·
course be taken away, to the general loss and impoverishment
of the kingdom and commonweal so reduced. Resides, when
our men are constrained to fight, it hath not the like hope as
when they are pressed and encouraged by th- desire of spoil and
riches. Farther, it is to be doubte‘ how those that in time of
victory seem to affect their neighl our nations will remain after
the first view of missortunes or ill success: to trust, also, to the
doubtfulness of a battle is but a fearful and uncertain adventure,
seeing therein fortune is as likely to prevail as virtue. It shall
not be necessary to allege all that might be said, and therefore Ι
will thus conclude3 that whatsoever kingdom shall be enforced
to defend itself may be compared to a body dangerously diseased,
which for a season may be preserved with vulgar medicines, but
in a short time, and by little and little, the same must needs fall
to the ground and be dissolved. I have therefore laboured all
my life, both according to my small power and persuasion, to
advance all those attempts that might either promise return
