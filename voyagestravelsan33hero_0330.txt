322 SIR WALTER RALEIGH

understand the rivers, watering-places, and ports of the
island, which, as it is rudely done, my purpose is to send
your Lordship after a few days. From Curiapan I came to
a port and seat of Indians called Parico, where we found a
fresh water river, but saw no people. From thence I rowed
to another port, called by the naturals Piche, and by the
Spaniards Tierra de Brea. In the way between both were
divers little brooks of fresh water, and one salt river that
had store of oysters upon the branches of the trees, and
were very salt and well tasted. All their oysters grow upon
those boughs and sprays, and not on the ground; the like is
commonly seen in other places of the W est I ndies, and else-
where. This tree is described by Arzdrew leevet‚ in his
France Antarctique, and the form figured in the book as a
plant very strange; and by Pliny in his twelfth book of his
Natural History. But in this island, as also in Guiana, there
are very many of them.

At this point, called Tierra de Brea or Piclze, there is that
abundance of stone pitch that all the ships of the world may
be therewith laden from thence; and we made trial of it in
trimming our ships to be most excellent good, and melteth
not with the sun as the pitch of Norway, and therefore for
ships trading the south parts very profitable. From thence
we went to the mountain foot called Annaperima, and so
passing the river Corone, on which the Spanish city was
seated, we met with our ships at Puarto de los Espafioles or
Conquerabia.

This island of Trinidad hath the form of a sheeph00k‚
and is but narrow; the north part is very mountainous; the
soil is very excellent, and will bear sugar‚ ginger, or any
other commodity that the Indics yield. It hath store of
deer, wild porks‚ fruit, fish, and fowl; it hath also for bread
sufficient maize‚ cassavi, and of those roots and fruits which
are common everywhere in the West Iudies. It hath divers
beasts which the Indies have *not; the Spaniards confessed
that they found grains of gold in some of the rivers; but
they having a purpose to enter Gaiana, the magazine of all
rich metals, cared not to spend time in the search thereos
any further. This island is called by the people thereos
Cairi, and in it are divers nations. Those about Parico are
