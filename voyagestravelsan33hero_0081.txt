EGYPT 73

priests and of kings: but three hundred generations of rnen
are equal to ten thousand years for a hundred years is
three generations of men; and in the one-and-forty genera-
tions which remain, those I mean which were added to the
three hundred, there are one thousand three hundred and
forty years. Thus in the period of eleven thousand three
hundred and forty years they said that there had arisen no
god in human form3 nor even before that time or after-
wards among the remaining kings who arose in Egypt, did
they report that anything of that kind had come to pass.
In this time they said that the sun had moved four times
from his accustomed place of rising, and where he now sets
he had thence twice had his rising, and in the place from
whence he now rises he had twice had his setting3 and in
the meantime nothing in Egypt had been changed from its ι
usual state, neither that which comes from the earth nor
that which comes to them from the river nor that which con-

before, the priests of Zeus did for him much the same as
they did for me (though I had not traced my descent).
They led me into the sanctuary of the temple, which is of
great size, and they counted up the number, showing colossal
wooden statues in number the same as they said; for each
chief-priest there sets up in his lifetime an image of himself:
accordingly the priests, counting and showing me these, de-
clared to me that each one of them was a son succeeding
his own father, and they went up through the series of
images from the image of the one who had died last, until
they had declared this of the whole number. And when
Hecataios had traced his descent and connected his family
with a god in the sixteenth generatim, they traced a descent
in opposition to his, besides their numbering, not accepting
it from him that a man had been born from a god3 and they
traced their counter-descent thus, saying that each one of the
statues had been piromis son of piromis, until they had de-
clared this of the whole three hundred and forty-five statues,
each one being surnamed piromis,· and neither with a god
nor a hero did they connect their descent. Now piramis
