ROUND THE WORLD 251

During our being in this town, as formerly also at San-
tiago there had passed justice upon the life of one of our
own company for an odious matter, so here likewise was
there an Irishman hanged for the murdering of his corporal.

In this time also passed many treaties between their com-
missioners and us, for ransom of their city; but upon dis-
agreements we still spent the early mornings in firing the
outmost houses; but they being built very magnificently of
stone, with high lofts, gave us no small travail to ruin them.
And albeit for divers days together we ordained each morn-

the walls, right over against you as you enter the said place,
so as your eye cannot escape the sight of it, there is described
and painted in a very large scutcheon the arms of the King
of Spain‚· and in the lower part of the said scutcheon their
is likewise described a globe, containing in it the whole cir-
