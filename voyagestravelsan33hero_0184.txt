176 SIR FRANCIS DR'AKE

February) till noon; during which time, they related unto
us divers very strange accidents, that had fallen out between
them and the Spaniards, namely [especially] one. A gallant
gentleman entertained by the Governors of the country, un-
dertook, the year last past [1572]‚ with 150 soldier5‚ to put
this town to the sword, rnen, women, and children. Being
conducted to it by one of thern, that had been taken prisoner,

roons that best knew the ways, went about a mile distance
before us, breaking boughs as they went, to be a direction
to those that followed; but with great silence, which they
also required us to keep.

T hen twelve of them were as it were our Vanguard, other
twelve, our Rearward. We with their two Captains in the
