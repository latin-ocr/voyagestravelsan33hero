218 DRAKE'S FAMOUS VOYAGE

ashore to the town of Santiago, to give them warning of
our arrival.

They of the town, being not above nine households‚
presently fled away and abandoned the town. Our General
manned his boat and the Spanish ship’s boat, and went to
the town ; and, being come to it, we rifled it, and carne to a
small chapel, which we entered, and found therein a silver
chalice, two cruets, and one altar-eloth, the spoil whereof our
General gave to Master Fletcher, his minister. We found
also in this town a warehouse stored with wine of Chili and
many boards of cedar-wood; all which wine we brought away
with us, and certain of the boards to burn for firewood.
And so, being come aboard, we departed the haven, having
first set all the Spaniards on land, saving one J ohn Griego,
a Greek born, whom our General carried with him as pilot
to bring him into the haven of Lima.

When we were at sea our General rifled the ship, and
found in her good store of the wine of Chili, and 25‚ooo

buried our man, and the Spaniards came down again with a
flag of truce 3 but we set sail, and would not trust them.
From hence we went to a certain port called Tarapaca;
where, being landed, we found by the sea side a Spaniard
lying asleep, who had lying by him thirteen bars of silver,
which weighed 4000 ducats Spanish. We took the silver .
and left the man. Not far from hence, going on land for
fresh water, we met with a Spaniard and an Indian boy
driving eight Hamas or-sheep of Peru, which are as big as
asses3 every of which sheep had on his back two bags of
leather‚ each bag containing 50 lb. weight of fine silver. So
that, bringing both the sheep and their burthen to the ships,
