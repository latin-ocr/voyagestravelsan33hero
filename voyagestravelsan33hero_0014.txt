6 HERODOTUS

namely that no man should utter any word in their presence,
and that they should be placed by themselves in a room where
none might come, and at the proper time he should bring
to them she-goats, and when he had satisfied them with milk
he should do for thern whatever else was needed. These
things Psammetichos did and gave him this charge wishing
to hear what word the children would let break t'orth first„
after they had ceased from wailings without sense. And
accordingly so it came to pass; for after a space of two
years had gone by, during which the shepherd went on
acting so, at length, when he opened the door and entered,
both the children fell before him in entreaty and uttered
the word bekos, stretching forth their hands. At first when
he heard this the shepherd kept silence; but since this word
was often repeated, as he visited them constantly and at-
tended to them, at last he declared the matter to his master,
and at his command he brought the children before his face.
Then Psammetichos having himself also heard it, began to
inquire what nation of men named anything bekos, and in-
quiring he found that the Phrygians had this name for
bread. In this manner and guided by an indication such as
this, the Egyptians were brought to allow that the Phrygians
were a more ancient people than themselves. That so it
came to pass Ι heard from the priests of that Hephaistos
who dwells at Memphis ; but the Hellenes relate, besides
many other idle tales, that Psammetichos cut out the tongues
of certain women and then caused the children to live with
these women.

With regard then to the rearing of the children they re-
lated so much as Ι have said: and Ι heard also other things
at Memphis when I had speech with the priests of Hephais-
tos. Moreover I visited both Thebes and Heliopolis for this
very cause, namely because Ι wished to know whether the
priests at these places would agree in their accounts with
those at Memphis; for the men of Heliopolis are said to
be the most learned in records of the Egyptians. Those of
their narrations which Ι heard with regard to the gods I
am not earnest to relate in full, but 1 shall name them only,
because I consider that all men are equally ignorant of
these matters: and whatever things of them I may record,
