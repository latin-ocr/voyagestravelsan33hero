of the crown of England, and the advancement of the
Christian religion in those paganish regions, requiring but
their lawful aid for repairing of his fleet, and supply of some

should deliver unto the merchants and masters of that harbour
a note of all their wants: which done, the ships,as well English

company and part of theu-s, to go into other harbours adjoin-

our provision: whereunto the Portugals, above other nations‚
did most willingly anl liberally contribute. In so much
