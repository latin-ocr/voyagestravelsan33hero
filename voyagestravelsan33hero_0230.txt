222 DRAKE’S FAMOUS VOYAGE

by the Cape of Buena Esperanza. Upon this resolution he
began to think of his best way to the Malucos, and finding
himself, where he now waS, becalmed, he saw that of neces-
sity he must be forced to take a Spanish course; namely, to
sail somewhat northerly to get a wind. We· therefore set
sail, and sailed 600 leagues at the least for a good wind ;
and thus much we sailed from the 16. of April till the third
of June.

The fifth of June, being in 43 degrees towards the pole
Arctic, we found the air so cold, that our men being griev-
ously pinched with the same, complained of the extremity
thereof; and the further we went, the more the cold in-
creased upon us, Whereupon we thought it best for that
time to seek the land, and did so; finding it not mountainous‚
but low plain land, till we carne within 38 degrees towards
the line. In which height it pleased God to send us into a

and have from the uttermost brims of the circle, clifts of
wood set upon them, joining close together at the top like
a spire steeple‚ which by reason of that closeness are very
warm. Their bed is the ground with rushes strowed on it;
and lying about the house, [they] have the fire in the midst.
The men go naked; the women take bulrushes, and kemb
them after the manner of hemp, and thereos make their
loose garments, which being knit about their middles, hang
down about their hips, having also about their shoulders a
skin of deer, with the hair upon it. These women are very
obedient and serviceable to their husbands.

After they were departed from us, they came and visited
