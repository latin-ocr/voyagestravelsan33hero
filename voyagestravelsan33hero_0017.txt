EGYPT 9

so far as it belongs to Egypt, and for about four days' sail
up the river Egypt properly so called is narrow: and the
space between the mountain-ranges which have been men-
tioned is plain—land, but where it is narrowest it did not
seem to me to exceed two hundred furlongs from the Ara-
bian mountains to those which are called the Libyan. After
this again Egypt is broad. Such is the nature of this land:
and from Heliopolis to Thebes is a voyage up the river of
nine days, and the distance of the journey in furlongs is
four thousand eight hundred and sixty, the number of
schoines being eighty-one. If these measures of Egypt in
furlongs be put together, the result is as follows :-1 have
already before this shown that the distance along the sea
amounts to three thousand six hundred furlongs, and Ι will
now declare what the distance is inland from the sea to
Thebes, namely six thousand one hundred and twenty fur-
longs: and again the distance from Thebes to the city called
Elephantine is one thousand eight hundred furlongs.

Of this land then, concerning which I have spoken, it
seemed to myself also, according as the priests said, that the
greater part had been won as an addition by the Egyptians;
for it was evident to me that the space between the afore-
said mountain—tanges, which lie above the city of Memphis,
once was a guli of the sea, like the regions about Ilion and
Teuthrania and Ephesos and the plain of the Maiander‚ if
it be permitted to compare small things with great; and
small these are in comparison, for of the rivers which
heaped up the soil in those regions none is worthy to be
compared in volume with a single one of the mouths of the
Nile, which has five mouths. Moreover there are other
rivers also, not in size at all equal to the Nile, which have
performed great feats; of which I can mention the names
of several, and especially the Acheloos, which flowing
through Acarnania and so issuing out into the sea has al-
ready made half of the Echinades from islands into main-
land. Now there is in the land of Arabia, not far from
Egypt, a guis of the sea running in from that which is
called the Erythraian Sea, very long and narrow, as 1
am about to tell. With respect to the length of the voyage
along it, one who set out from the innerrnost point to sail
