THIRD VOYAGE 167

and understood that she had neither meat nor money, but
that she was bound for Rio Grande to take in provision upon
bills, our great hope converted into grief.

We endured with our allowance seven or eight days more,
proceeding to the Eastward, and bearing room for Santa
Marta, upon hope to find some shipping in the road, or
limpets on the rocks, or succour against the storrn in that
good harbour, Being arrived; and seeing no shipping; we
anchored under the wester[n] point, where is high land, and,

either of the islands were not very populous, or else it would
be very likely that there would be found ships of victual in
a readiness.

The company of the other pinnace answered, that “They
would willingly follow him through the world; but in this
