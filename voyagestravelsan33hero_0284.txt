276 GILBERT'S VOYAGE

intermeddled with base purposes, as many have made the
same but a colour to shadow actions otherwise scaree
justifiable; which doth excite God’s heavy judgments in the
end, to the terrifying of weak minds from the cause, with-
out pondering His just proceedings; and doth also incense
foreign princes against our attempts, how just soever, who
cannot but deem the sequel very dangerous unto their state
(if in those parts we should grow to strength), seeing the
very beginnings are entered with spoil.

And with this admonition denounced upon zeal towards
God’s cause, also towards those in whom appea'reth dis-
position honourable unto this action of planting Christian
people and religion in those remote and barbarous nations of
' America (unto whom Ι wish all happiness), I will now pro-
ceed to make relation briefly, yet particularly, of our voyage
undertaken with Sir Humfrey Gilbcrt, begun, continued, and
ended adversely.

When first Sir Humfrey Gilbert undertook the western
discovery of America, and had procured from her Majesty
a very large commission to inhabit and possess at his choice
all remote and heathen lands not in the actual possession ot*
any Christian prince, the same commission exemplified with
many privileges, such as in his discretion he might demand,
very many gentlemen of good estimation drew unto him, to
associate him in so commendable an enterprise, so that the
preparation was expected to grow unto a puissant fleet, able
to encounter a king’s power by sea. Nevertheless‚ amongst
a multitude of voluntary men, their dispositions were diverse,
which bred a jar, and made a division in the end, to the
confusion of that attempt even before the same was begun.
And when the shipping was in a manner prepared, and men
ready upon the coast to go aboard, at that time some brake
eonsort, and followed courses degenerating from the voyage
before pretended. Others failed of their promises con-
tracted, and the greater number were dispersed, leaving the
General with few of his assured friends, with whom he ad-
ventured to sea3 where, having tasted of no less misfortune‚
he was shortly driven to retire horne with the loss of a tall
ship and, more to his grief, of a valiant gensseman, Miles
Morgan.
