290 GILBERT'S VOYAGE

plots that were drawn, with the due gradation of the har-
bours, bays, and capes, did perish with the Admiral: where-
fore in the description following, I must omit the particulars
of such things.

That which we do call the N ewfoundland, and the French-
men Βαεεαῖαος, is an island, or rather, after the opinion of
some, it consisteth of sundry islands and broken lands. situ-
ate in the north regions of America, upon the guli and
entrance of a great river called St. Lawrence in Canada;
into the which, navigation may be made both on the south
and north side of this island. The land lieth south and
s north, containing in length between 300 and 400 miles, ac-
counting from Cape Race, which is in 46 degrees 25 minutes,
unto the Grand Ray in 52 degrees, of septentrional latitude.
The land round about hath very many goodly bays and har—
bours, safe roads for ships, the like not to be found in any
part of the known world.

The common opinion that is had of intemperature and
extreme cold that should be in this country, as of some part
it may be verified, namely the north, where Ι grant it is rnore
cold than in countries of Europe, which are under the same
elevation: even so it cannot stand with reason and nature
of the clime, that the south parts should be so intemperate
as the bruit hath gone. For as the same do lie under the
elimes of Bretagne, Anjou, Poictou in France, between 46
and 49 degrees, so can they not so much differ from the
temperature of those countries: unless upon the out-coast
lying open unto the ocean and sharp winds, it must indeed
be subject to more cold than further within the land, where
the mountains are interposed as walls and bulwarks, to
defend and to resist the asperity and rigour of the sea and
weather. Some hold opinion that the Newfozmdland might
be the more subject to cold, by how much it lieth high and
near unto the middle region. Ι grant that not in N ewfound-
land alone, but in Germany, Italy and Afric, even under the
equinoctial line, the mountains are extreme cold, and sel-
dom uneovered of snow, in their culm and highest topS,
which cometh to pass by the same reason that they are ex-
tended towards the middle region: yet in the countries lying
beneath them, it is found quite contrary. Even so, all hius
