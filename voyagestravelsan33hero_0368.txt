360 SIR WALTER RALEIGH

would have ended in mishapS. But we fastened an anchor
upon the land, and with main strength drew her off; and so
the fifteenth day we discovered afar off the mountains of
Guiana, to our great joy, and towards the evening had a
slent³⁹ of a northerly wind that blew very strong, which
brought us in sight of the great river Orenoque; out of
which this river descended wherein we were. We descried
afar off three other canoas as far as we could discern them,
after whom we hastened with our barge and wherries‚ but
two of them passed out of sight, and the third entered up the
great river, on the right hand to the westward‚ and there
stayed out of sight, thinking that we meant to take the way
eastward towards the province of Carapana; for that way
the Spaniards keep, not daring to go upwards to Guiana,
the people in those parts being all their enemies, and those
in the canoas thought us to have been those Spaniards that
were fled from Trinidad, and escaped killing. And when
we came so far down as the opening of that branch into
which they slipped, being near them with our barge and
wherries‚ we made atter them, and yere they could land
came within call, and by our interpreter told them what we
were, wherewith they came back willingly aboard us3 and
of such fish and z‘orz‘ugas’4⁰ eggs as they had gathered they
gave us, and promised in the morning to bring the lord of
that part with them, and to do us all other services they
could. T hat night we came to an anchor at the parting of the
three goodly rivers (the one was the river of Amana, by
which we came from the north, and ran athwart towards
the south, the other two were of Orenoque, which crossed
from the west and ran to the sea towards the east) and
landed upon a fair sand, where we found thousands of
tortugas' eggs, which are very wholesome meat, and greatly
restoring; so as our men were now well filled and highly
contented both with the fare, and nearness of the land of
Guiana, which appeared in sight.

In the morning there came down, according to promise„
the lord of that border, called Toparimaca, with some thirty
or forty followers, and brought us divers sorts of frusts, and
of his wine, bread, fish‚ and flesh, whom we also feasted as

⁸⁹ Push. 4⁰ Turtles.
