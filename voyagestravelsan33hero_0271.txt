ROUND THE WORLD 263

up alongst the river-side to see what place the enemy held
there; for none amongst us had any knowledge thereos
at all.

Here the General took occasion to march with the corn-
panies himself in person, the Lieutenant-General having the
vant-guard; and, going a mile up, or somewhat more, by the
river-side, we might discern on the other side of the river
over against us a fort which newly had been built by the
Spaniards; and some mile, or thereabout‚ above the fort was
a little town or village without walls built of wooden houses‚
as the plot doth plainly shew. We forthwith prepared to
have ordnance for the battery; and one piece was a little
before the evening planted, and the first shot being made by
the Lieutenant-General himself at their ensign, strake
through the ensign, as we afterwards understood by a
Frenchman which came unto us from thern. One shot more
was then made, which struck the foot of the fort wall, which
was all massive timber of great trees like masts. The
Lieutenant-General was determined to pass the river this
night with four companies, and there to lodge himself en-
trenched as near the fort as that he might play with his
muskets and smallest shot upon any that should appear, and
so afterwards to bring and plant the battery with him; but
the help of mariners for that sudden to make trenches could
not be had, which was the cause that this determination
was remitted until the next night.

In the night the Lieutenant—General took a little rowing
skiff and half a dozen well armed, as Captain Morgcm and
Captain Sampson, with some others, besides the rowers, and
went to view what guard the enemy kept, as also to take
knowledge of the ground. And albeit he went as covertly
as might be, yet the enemy, taking the alarm, grew fearful
that the whole force was approaching to the assaust, and
therefore with all speed abandoned the place after the shoot-
ing of some of their pieces. They thus gone, and he being
returned unto us again, but nothing knowing of their flight
from their fort, forthwith came a Frenchman? being a fifer
(who had been prisoner with them) in a little boat, playing

⁹Nicolas Borgoignon. The ‘Prince of Orange's Song’ was a popular
ditty in praise of William Prince of orange (assassinated 1584), the leader
of the Dutch Protestant insurgents.
