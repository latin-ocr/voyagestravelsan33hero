have bows stretch them at such time as they wish to use them,
and when they have finished using them they loose them
again3 for if they were stretched tight always they would
break, so that the men would not be able to use them when
they needed thern. So also is the state of man: if he should
always be in earnest and not relax himself for sport at the
due time, he would either go mad or be struck with stupor be-
fore he was aware; and knowing this well, I distribute a
portion of the time to each οἱ the two ways of living.” Thus
he replied to his friends. It is said however that Amasis,
even when he was in a private station, was a lover of drink-

in regard to height and greatness, so large are the stones and
of such quality. Then secondly he dedicated great colossal
statues and man-headed sphinxes very large, and for restora-

these he caused to be brought from the stone-quarries which
are opposite Memphis, others of very great size from the
city of Elephantine, distant a voyage of not less than twenty
days from Sais: and of them all 1 marvel most at this,
namely a monolith chamber which he brought from the city
of Elephantine; and they were three years engaged in bring-
