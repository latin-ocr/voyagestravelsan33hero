142 SIR FRANCIS DRAKE

And to make a shew of far greater numbers of shot,
or else οἱ a custom they had, by the like device to terrify
the Cimaroons; they had hung lines with matches lighted,
overthwart the wester[n] end of the Market Place‚ between
the Church and the Cross; as though there had been in a
readiness some company of shot, whereas indeed there
were not past two or three that taught these lines to dame,
till they themselves ran away, as soon as they perceived
they were discovered.

But the soldiers and such as were joined with them,
presented us with a jolly hot volley of shot, beating full
upon the full egress of that street, in which we marched;
and levelling very low, so as their bullets ofttimes grazed
on the sand.

We stood not to answer them in like terms: but having
discharged our first volley of shot, and feathered them
with our arrows (which our Captain had caused to be made
of purpose in England; not great sheat‘ arrow5, but fine
roving shafts‚ very carefully reserved for the service)
we carne to the push of pike, so that our firepikes being well
armed and made of purpose, did us very great service.

For our men with their pikes and short weaponS, in
short time took such order among these gallants (some
using the butt—end of their pieces instead of other weapons),
that partly by reason of our arrows which did us there
notable service, partly by occasion of this strange and
sudden closing with them in this manner unlooked for,
and the rather for that at the very instant, our Captain's
brother, with the other company, with their firepikes, entered
the Market Place by the easter[n] street: they casting
down their weapons, fled all out of the town by the gate
aforesaid, which had been built for a bar to keep out of
the town the Cimaroons, who had often assailed it; but now
served for a gap for the Spaniards to fly at.

In following, and returning; divers of our men were hurt
with the weapons which the enemy had let fall as he fled;
somewhat‚ for that we marched with such speed, but more
for that they lay so thick and cross one on the other.

Being returned, we made our stand near the midst of the
Market Place, where a tree groweth hard by the Cross;
