3 HERODOTUS

itself‚ the extent of it along the sea is sixty schoines, accord-
ing to our definition of Egypt as extending from the Gulf
of Plinthine to the Serbonian lake, along which stretches
Mount Casion; from this lake then the sixty schoines are
reckoned: for those of men who are poor in land have their
country measured by fafflorns, those who are less poor by
furlongs, those who have much land by parasangs‚ and those
who have land in very great abundance by schoines: now
the parasang is equal to thirty furlongs‚ and each schoine,
which is an Egyptian measure, is equal to sixty furlongs.
So there would be an extent of three thousand six hundred
furlongs for the coast-land of Egypt. From thence and as
far as Heliopolis inland Egypt is broad, and the land is all
flat and without springs of water and formed of mud: and
the road as one goes inland from the sea to Heliopolis is
about the same in length as that which leads from the altar
of the twelve gods at Athens to Pisa and the temple of
Olympian Zeus: reckoning up you would find the difference
very small by which these roads fail of being equal in
length, not more indeed than fifteen furlongs3 for the road
from Athens to Pisa wants fifteen furlongs of being fifteen
hundred, while the road to Heliopolis from the sea reaches
that number completely. From Heliopolis however, as you
go up, Egypt is narrow; for on the one side a mountain-
range belonging to Arabia stretches along by the side of it,
going in a direction from the North towards the midday
and the South Wind, tending upwards without a break to
that which is called the Erythraian Sea, in which range
are the stone-quarries which were used in cutting stone
for the pyramids at Memphis, On this side then the moun-
tain ends where I have said, and then takes a turn back;
and where it is widest, as Ι was informed, it is a Journey of
two months across from East to West; and the borders of
it which turn towards the East are said to produce frank-
incense. Such then is the nature of this mountain-range;
and on the side of Egypt towards Libya another range
extends, rocky and enveloped in sand: in this are the pyra-
mids, and it runs in the same direction as those parts of the
Arabian mountains which go towards the midday. So then,
1 say, from Heliopolis the land has no longer a great extent
