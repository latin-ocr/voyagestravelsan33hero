THIRD VOYAGE 189

what was to be done in this meantime, and how they stood
affected?

Some thought, that “ It was most necessary to seek supply
of victuals, that we might the better be able to keep our men
close and in health till our time came: and this was easy to
be compassed, because the frigates with victuals„ went with-
out great defence, whereas the frigate and barks with
treasure, for the most part were wat'ted with great ships
and store of soldiers.”

Others yet judged, “ We might better bestow our time in
intercepting the frigates of treasure; first, for that our
magazines and storehouses of victuals were reasonably fur-
nished‚ and the country itself was so plentiful, that every
man might provide for himself if the worst befell: and
victuals might hereafter be provided abundantly as well as
now: whereas the treasure never floateth upon the sea, so
ordinarily as at this time οἱ the Fleets being there, which
time in no wise may be neglected.’'

The Cimaroons being demanded also their opinion (for
that they were experienced in the particularities of all the
towns thereabouts‚ as in which some or other of them had
served), declared that “by Veragua, Signior PEzoRo (some
time their master from whom they fied) dwelt3 not in the
town for sear of some surprise, but yet not far off from the
town, for his better relief; in a very strong house of stone,
where he had dwelt nineteen years at least, never travelling
from home; unless happily once a year to Cartagena, or
Nombre de Dios when the Fleets were there. He keepeth a
hundred slaves at least in the mines, each slave being bound
to bring in daily, clear gain (all charges deducted) three Pesos
of Gold for himself and two for his women (gs. 3d. the Peso),
amounting in the whole, to above {200 sterling [=21,600 Ι
now] each day: so that he hath heaped a mighty mass of
treasure together, which he keepeth in certain great chests,
of two feet deep, three broad, and four long: being (not,
withstanding all his wealth) bad and cruel not only to his
slaves, but unto all men, and therefore never going abroad
but with a guard of five or six men to defend his person
from danger, which he feareth extraordinarily from all
creatures.”
