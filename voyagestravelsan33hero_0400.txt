392 SIR WALTER RALEIGH

passable mountains on every side, as it is impossible to vict-
ual any company in the passage. Which hath been well
proved by the Spanish nation, who since the conquest of
Peru have never left five years free from attempting this
empire, or discovering some way into it; and yet of three-
and-twenty several gentlemen, knights, and noblemen, there
was never any that knew which way to lead an army by
land, or to conduct ships by sea, -anything near the said
country. Orellamz, of whom the river of Amazons taketh
name, was the first, and Don Antonio de &erre-0, whom we
displanted‚ the last: and Ι doubt much whether he himself
or any of his yet know the best way into the said empire.
It can therefore hardly be regained, if any strength be
formerly set down, but in one or two places, and but two or
three erumsters⁵⁴ or galleys built and furnished upon the
river within. The West Jndies have many ports, watering
·, places, and landings; and nearer than 300 miles to Gaiana,
no man can harbour a ship, except he know one only place,
which is not learned in haste, and which I will undertake
there is not any one of my companies that knoweth‚ whoso-
ever hearkened most after it.

Besides, by keeping one good fort, or building one town
of strength, the whole empire is guarded3 and whatsoever
companies shall be afterwards planted within the land, al-
though in twenty several provinces, those shall be able all
to reunite themselves upon any occasion either by the way
of one river, or be able to march by land without either
wood, bog, or mountain. Whereas in the West Indies there
are few towns or provinces that can succour or relieve one
the other by land or sea. By land the countries are either
desert, mountainouS, or strong enemies. By sea, if any man
invade to the eastward, those to the west cannot in many
months turn against the breeze and eastern wind. Besides,
the Spaniards are therein so dispersed as they are nowhere
strong, but in Naeva Espaiia only; the sharp mountains, the
thorns, and poisoned prickles, the sandy and deep ways in
the valleys, the smothering heat and air, and want of water
in other places are their only and best defence; which, be—
cause those nations that invade them are not victualled or
