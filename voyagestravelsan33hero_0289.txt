To NEWFOUNDLAND 281

OUR CoURsE agreed upon.

Tm: course first to be taken for the discovery is to bear
directly to Cape Race, the most southerly cape of N ewfound-
land,· and there to harbour ourselves either in Rogneux or
Fermous, being the first places appointed for our rendez-
vous, and the next harbours unto the northward of Cape
Race: and therefore every ship separated from the fleet to .
repair to that place so fast as God shall permit, whether
you shall fall to the southward or to the northward of it, and
there to stay for the meeting of the whole fleet the space
of ten days; and when you shall depart, to leave marks.

BEGINNING our course from Scilly, the nearest is by west-
south-west (if the wind serve) until such time as we have
brought ourselves in the latitude of 43 or 44 degi-ees, because
the ocean is subject much to southerly winds in June and
July. Then to take traverse from 45 to 47 degrees of lati-
tude, if we be enforced by contrary winds ; and not to go to
the northward of the height of 47 degrees of septentrional
latitude by no means, if God shall not enforce the contrary;
but to do your endeavour to keep in the height of 46 degrees,
so near as you can possibly, because Cape Race lieth about
that height.

N οΤΕ.

IF by contrary winds we be driven back upon the coast of
England, then to repair unto Scilly for a place of our as·
sembly or meeting. If we be driven back by contrary winds
that we cannot pass the coast of Ireland, then the place of
our assembly to be at Bere haven or Baltimore haven. If
we shall not happen to meet at Cape Race, then the place of
rendez-vous to be at Cape Breton, or the nearest harbour
unto the westward of Cape Breton. If by means of other
shipping we may not safely stay there, then to rest at the
very next safe port to the westward; every ship leaving their
marks behind them for the more certainty of the after
comers to know where to find them. The marks that every
man ought to leave in such a case, were of the General’s
private device written by himself, sealed also in close wax,
and delivered unto every ship one seron, which was not to be.
