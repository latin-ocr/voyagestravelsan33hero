ROUND THE WORLD 233

children, bringing with them such victuals as they think good,
some fruits, some rice boiled, some hens roasted, some sagn,
having a table made three foot from the ground, whereon
they set their meat, that every person sitting at the table
may eat, one rejoicing in the company of another. They
boil their rice in an earthen pot, made in form of a sugat
loaf, being full of holes, as our pots which we water our
gardens withal, and it is open at the great end, wherein they
put their rice dry, without any moisture. In the mean time
they have ready another great earthen pot, set fast in a
furnace, boiling full of water, whereinto they put their pot
with rice, by such measure, that they swelling become soft at
the first, and by their swelling stopping the holes of the pot,
admit no more water to enter, but the more they are boiled,
the harder and more firm substance they become. So that
in the end they are a firm and good bread, of the which with
oil, butter, sugar‚ and other spices, they make divers sorts
of meats very pleasant of taste‚ and nourishing to nature.
* * * Not long before our departure, they told us that not
far off there were such great ships as our5‚ wishing us to
beware; upon this our captain would stay no longer. From
sava Major we sailed for the Cape of Good Hope, which
was the first land we fell withal; neither did we touch with
it, or any other land, until we came to Sierra Leona, upon
the coast of Guinea; notwithstanding we ran hard aboard
the cape, finding the report of the Portugals to be most false,
who affirm that it is the most dangerous cape of the world,
never without intolerable storms and present danger to
travellers which come near the same. This cape is a most
stately thing, and the fairest cape we saw in the whole cir-
eumference ot‘ the earth, and we passed by it the 18. of June.
From thence we continued our course to Sierra Leona, on
the coast of Guinea, where we arrived the 22. of July, and
found necessary provisions, great store of elephants, oysters
upon trees ot' one kind,²⁴ spawning and increasing infinitely‚
the oyster suffering no bud to grow. We departed thence
the four and twentieth day.

We arrived in England the third os November, 1580, being
the third year of our departure.
