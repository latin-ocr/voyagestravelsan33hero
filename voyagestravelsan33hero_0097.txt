EGYP'I· 89

ing this, and two thousand men were appointed to convey it,
who all were of the class of boatmen. Of this house the
length outside is one-and—twenty cubits, the breadth is four-
teen cubits, and the height eight. These are the measures
of the monolith house outside; but the length inside is
eighteen cubits and five-sixths of a cubit, the breadth twelve
cubits‚ and the height five cubits. This lies by the side of
the entrance to the temple; for within the temple they did not
draw it, because, as it is said, while the house was being
drawn along, the chief artificer of it groaned aloud, seeing
that much time had been spent and he was wearied by the
work; and Amasis took it to heart as a warning and did
not allow them to draw it further onwards. Some say on
the other hand that a man was killed by it, of those who
were heaving it with levers, and that it was not drawn in
for that reason. Amasis also dedicated in all the other tem-
ples which were of repute, works which are worth seeing
for their size, and among thern also at Memphis the colossal
statue which lies on its back in front of the temple of
Hephaistos, whose length is five—and-seventy feet ; and on
the same base made of the same stone are set two colossal
statues, each of twenty feet in length, one on this side and
the other on that side of the large statue. There is also
another of stone of the same size in Sais, lying in the same
manner as that at Memphis. Moreover Amasis was he who
built and finished for Isis her temple at Memphis, which is
of great size and very worthy to be seen.

In the reign of Amasis it is said that Egypt became more
prosperous than at any other time before, both in regard to
that which comes to the land from the river and in regard
to that which comes from the land to its inhabitants, and
that at this time the inhabited towns in it numbered in all
twenty thousand. It was Amasis too who established the law
that every year each one of the Egyptians should declare to the
ruler of his district, from what source he got his livelihood,

and if any man did not do this or did not make declaration .

of an honest way of living, he should be punished with death.
Now Solon the Athenian received from Egypt this law and
had it enacted for the Athenians, and they have continued to
observe it, since it is a law with which none can find fault.
