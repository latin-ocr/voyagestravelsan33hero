ROUND THE WORLD 249

Master carlile, our Lieutenant-General; at which time, being
about eight of the clock, we began to march. And about
noon-time, or towards one of the clock, we approached the
town ; where the gentlemen and those of the better sort,
being some hundred and fifty brave horses, or rather more,
began to present themselves. But our small shot played

more truly understood, a place of very spacious square
ground ; whither also came, as had been agreed, Captain
Powell with the other troop. Which place with some
part next unto it, we strengthened with barricados, and
