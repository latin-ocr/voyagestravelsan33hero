DISCOVERY OF GUIANA 313

which by her Maiesty's grace I hold this day in Enyland, to run
from cape to cape and from place to place, for the pillage of
ordinary prizes. Many years since I had knowledge, by relation,
of that mighty, rich, and beautiful empire of Guiana, and of that
great and golden city, which the Spaniards call El Dorado, and
the naturals Manoa, which city was conquered‚ re-edified‚ and en-
larged by a younger son of Guayna-capac‚ Emperor of Peru, at
such time as Francisco Pisarro and others conquered the said
empire from his two elder brethren, Guascar and Atabalipa, both
then contending for the same, the one being favoured by the
orejones of Cuzco, the other by the people ossaxamalca. I
sent my servant Jacob leiddon, the year before, to get knowl-
edge of the passages, and I had some light from Captain Parker,
sometime my servant, and now attending on your Lordship‚ that
such a place there was to the southward of the great bay of
Charuas, or Guanipa: but I found that it was 600 miles farther
off than they supposed, and many impediments to them unknown

who was upon the same enterprise‚ leaving my ships at Trinidad,
at the port called Curiapan, I wandered 400 miles into the said
country by land and river3 the particulars Ι will leave to the
following discourse.

The country hath more quantity of gold, by manifold‚ than

of the borders are already become her Majesty’s vassals‚ and
seem to desire nothing more than her Maiesty’s protection and
the return of the English nation. It hath another ground and
assurance of riches and glory than the voyages of the West
Indies,· an easier way to invade the best parts thereof than by
the common course. The king of Spain is not so impoverished
by taking three or four port towns in America as we suppose3
neither are the riches of Peru or Nueva Espaa‘ia so left by the
sea side as it can be easily washed away with a great flocci, or
spring tide, or left dry upon the sands on a low ebb. The port
towns are few and poor in respect of the rest within the land,
and are of little defence, and are only rich when the fleets are to
receive the treasure for Spain; and we might think the Spaniards
very simple, having so many horses and slaves, if they could
not upon two days' warning carry all the gold they have into the
land, and far enough from the reach of our footmen, especially
