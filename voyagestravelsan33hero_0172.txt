164 SIR FRANCIS DRAKE

were fain to row towards them, till that approaching very
nigh, we saw many heads peering over board. For, as we
perceived, these two frigates were manned and set forth
out of Cartagena, to fight with us, and, at least, to impeach
or busy us; whilst by some means or other they might re-
cover the frigates from uS.

But our Captain prevented both their drifts. For eom-
manding JOHN OXNAM to stay with the one pinnace, to
entertain these two Men-of—war; himself in the other made
such speed, that he got to his frigates which he had left at
anchor; and caused the Spaniards (who in the meantime had
gotten aboard in a small canoe, thinking to have towed them
within the danger of their shot) to make greater haste

For he found that in shifting thence, some of them were

into the harbour before them, to the great joy of the
Spaniards; who beheld it; in supposing, that we would still
have fied before them. But as soon as we were in the
harbour, and felt smooth water, our pinnaces, as we were
· assured of, getting the wind, we sought with them upon the
advantage, so that after a few shot exchanged, and a storm
rising, they were contented to press no nearer. Therefore
as they let fall their anchors, we presently let drop our grap-
ner in the wind of them: which the Spanish soldiers seeing,
considering the disadvantage of the wind, the likelihood of
the storm to continue, and small hope of doing any good,
they were glad to retire themselves to the town.

But by reason of the foul and tempestuous weather, we
