56 HERODOTUS

and from whence he was voyaging; and he both recounted
to him his descent and told him the name of his native
land, and moreover related of his voyage, from whence he
was sailing. After this Proteus asked him whence he had taken
Helen; and when Alexander went astray in his account and
did not speak the truth‚ those who had become suppliants
convicted him of falsehood, relating in full the whole tale of
the wrong done. At length Proteus declared to them this
sentence, saying, “ Were it not that Ι count it a matter of
great moment not to slay any of those strangers who being
driven from their course by winds have come to my land
hitherto, I should have taken vengeance on thee on behalf
of the man of Hellas, seeing that thou, most base of men,
having received from him hospitality, didst work against
him a most impious deed. For thou didst go in to the wife
of thine own host3 and even this was not enough for thee,
but thou didst stir her up with desire and hast gone away
with her like a thief. Moreover not even this by itself was
enough for thee, but thou art come hither with plunder
taken from the house of thy host. Now therefore depart,
seeing that Ι have counted it of great moment not to be a
slayer of strangers. This woman indeed and the wealth
which thou hast Ι will not allow thee to carry away, but Ι
shall keep them safe for the Hellene who was thy host, un-
til he come himself and desire to carry them off to his home;
to thyself however and thy fellow-voyagers Ι proclaim that
ye depart from your anchoring within three days and go
from my land to some other ; and if not, that ye will be dealt
with as enemies.''

This the priests said was the manner of Helen's coming
to Proteus; and I suppose that Homer also had heard this ¹
story, but since it was not so suitable to the composition of
his poem as the other which he followed, he dismissed it
finally, making it clear at the same time that he was ac-
quainted with that story also: and according to the manner
in which he described the wanderings of Alexander in the
Iliad (nor did he elsewhere retract that which he had said)
it is clear that when he brought Helen he was carried out
of his course, wandering to various lands, and that he came
among other places to Sidon in Phenicia. Of this the poet
