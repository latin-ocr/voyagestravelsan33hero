ration and description of the Newfoundlana', and proceed to
the rest of our voyage, which ended tragically.

While the better sort of us were seriously occupied in
repairing our wantS, and contriving of matters for the corn-
modity of our voyage, others of another sort and disposition
were plotting of misehief; some casting to steal away our
shipping by night, watching opportunity by the General's and
captains’ lying on the shore3 whose conspiracies discovered,
they were prevented. Others drew together in company, and
carried away out of the harbours adj oining a ship laden with
fish, setting the poor men on shore. A great many more of
our people stole into the woods to hide themselves, attending

The General made choice to go in his frigate the Squirrel,

frigate was prepared with her nettings and fights‚ and over-
charged with bases and such small ordnance, more to give
a show, than with judgment to foresee unto the safety of
her and the men, which afterward was an occasion also of
their overthrow,

Now having made ready our shipping‚ that is to say, the
Delight, the Golden Hind, and the Squirrel, we put aboard
our provision, which was wines, bread or rusk‚ fish wet and
