258 DRAKE’S FAMOUS VOYAGE

portance to the Spaniard of all the cities which be on this side of
the lVest India: we do therefore consider, that since all these cities,

. with their goods and prisoners taken in them, and the ransoms of

the said cities, being all put together, are found far short to satisfy
that expectationi which by the generality of the enterprisers was first
conceived; and being further advised of the slenderness of our
strength, whereunto we be now reduced, as well in respect of the small
number of able bodies, as also not a little in regard of the slack dis-
position of the greater part of those which remain, very many of the
better minds and men being either consumed by death or weakened
by sickness and hurts; and lastly, since that as yet there is not laid
down to our knowledge any such cnterprise as may seem convenient
to be undertaken with such few as we are presently able to make,
and witha] of such certain likelihood‚ as with God’s good success
which it may please him to bestow upon us, the same may promise
to yield us any sufficient contentment: we do therefore conclude
hereupon, that it is better to hold sure as we may the honour already
gotten, and with the same to return towards our gracious sovereign
and country, from whence. if it shall please her MaJesty to set
us forth again with her orderly means and entertainment‚ we are
most ready and willing to go through with anything that the utter-
most of our strength and endeavour shall be able to reach unto. But
therewithal we do advise and protest that it is far from our thoughts,
either to refuse, or so much as to seem to be weary of anything,

which for the present shall be further required or directed to be done
by us from our General.’

THE THIRD and last point is concerning the ransom of this city
ot Carthagena, for the which, before it was touched with any fire,
there was made an offer of some AEzzooo or 5328,000 sterling :—

‘Thus much we utter herein as our opinions, agreeing‚ so it be
done in good sort, to accept this offer aforesaid, rather than to break
off by standing still upon our demands of se1oo,ooo; which seems a
matter impossible to be performed for the present by them. And to
say nuth, we may now with much honour and reputation better be
satisfied with that sum offered by them at the first, if they will now
be contented to give it, than we might at that time with a great
deal more; inasmuch as we have taken our full pleasure, both in the
uttermost sacking and spoiling of all their household goods and mer-
chandise, as also in that we have eonsumed and ruined a great part
of their town with fire. And thus much further is considered herein
by us; that 35 there be in the voyage a great many poor men, who
have willingly adventured their lives and travails, and divers amongst
them having spent their apparel and such other little provisions as
their small means might have given them leave to prepare, which
being done upon such good and allowable ‘intention as this action
hath always carried with it (meaning, against the Spaniard, our
greatest and most dangerous enemy), so surely we cannot but have
an inward regard, so far as may lie in us, to help them in all good
sort towards the satisfaction of this their expectation3 and by
