102 TACITUS

displease, they reject it by an inarticulate murmur: if it
be pleasing, they brandish their javelins. The most
honourable manner of signifying their assent, is to express
their applause by the sound of their arms.

In the assembly it is allowed to present accusations, and
to prosecute capital offences. Punishments vary accord-
ing to the quality of the crime. Traitors and deserters they
hang upon trees. Cowards, and sluggards‚ and unnatural
prostitutes they smother in mud and bogs under an heap
of hurdles. Such diversity in their executions has this
view, that in punishing of glaring iniquities, it behoves
likewise to display them to sight; but effeminacy and
pollution must be buried and concealed. In lighter trans-
gressions too the penalty is measured by the fault, and the
delinquents upon conviction are condemned to pay a cer-
tain number of horses or cattle. Part of this mulct accrues
to the King or to the community, part to him whose wrongs
are vindicated, or to his next kindred. In the same as-
semblies are also chosen their chiefs or rulers, such as
administer justice in their villages and boroughs. To each
of these are assigned an hundred persons chosen from
amongst the populace, to accompany and assist him, men
who help him at once with their authority and their counsel.

Without being armed they transact nothing, whether of
public or private concernment. But it is repugnant to their
custom for any man to use arms, before the community has
attested his capacity to wield them. Upon such testimonial,
either one of the rulers, or his father, or some kinsman
dignify the young man in the midst of the assembly, with
a shield and javelin. This amongst them is the manly robe,
this the first degree of honour conferred upon their youth.
Before this they seem no more than part of a private family,
but thenceforward part of the Commonweal. The princely
dignity they confer even upon striplings, whose race is
eminently noble, or whose fathers have done great and
signal services to the State. For about the rest, who are
more vigorous and long since tried, they crowd to attend:
nor is it any shame to be seem amongst the followers of
these. Nay, there are likewise degrees of followers, higher
or lower, just as he whom they follow judges fit. Mighty
