they made good report‚ and some of thern had will to be

everywhere.

The distance between Cape Race and Cape Breton is 87
leagues; in which navigation we spent eight days, having
many times the wind indifferent good, yet could we never
attain sight of any land all that time, seeing we were hindered
hy the current. At last we fell into such flats and dangers,
that hardly any of us escaped3 where nevertheless we lost
our Admira1²⁰ with all the men and provisions, not knowing
certainly the place. Yet for inducing men of skill to make
conjecture, by our course and way we held from Cape Race
thither, that thereby the flats and dangers may be inserted
in sea cards, for warning to others that may follow the
same course hereafter, Ι have set down the best reckonings
that were kept by expert men, William Cox, Master of the

Our course we held in clearing us of these flats was east-

which by no contradiction could be brought to hold another
course, alleging they could not make the ship to work better,
nor to lie otherways. The evening was fair and pleasant,

this W ednesday night, like the swan that singeth before her
death, they in the Admiral, or Delight, continued in sounding
of trumpets‚ with drums and fifes; also winding the cornets
and hautboys, and in the end of their jollity‚ left with the
ι battle and ringing of doleful knells. Towards the evening
also we caught in the Golden Hind a very mighty porpoise
with a harping iron, having first stricken divers of them, and
brought away part of their flesh sticking upon the iron, but
