land, and from this very cause it was that they began to
be counted as Hellenes. Whosoever has been initiated in
the mysteries of the Cabeiroi, which the Samothrakians
perform having received them from the Pelasgians, that
man knows the meaning of my speech; for these very
Pelasgians who became dwellers with the Athenians used
to dwell before that time in Samothrake, and from thern
the Samothrakians received their mysteries. So then
the Athenians were the first of the Hellenes who made the
images of Hermes with the phallos, having learnt from the
Pelasgians; and the Pelasgians told a sacred story about
it, which is set forth in the mysteries in Samothrake. Now
the Pelasgians formerly were wont to make all their sacri-
fices calling upon the gods in prayer, as I know from that
which I heard at Dodona, but they gave no title or name to
any of them, for they had not yet heard any, but they called
thern gods (θεοὺς) from some such notion as this, that they
had set (θέντες) in order all things and so had the distribu-
tion of everything. Afterwards when much time had
elapsed, they learnt from Egypt the names of the gods, all
except Dionysos, for his name they learnt long after-
wards; and after a time the Pelasgians consulted the Oraele
at Dodona about the names, for this prophetie seat is ac-
counted to be the most ancient of the Oracles which are
among the Hellenes‚ and at that time it was the only one.
So when the Pelasgians asked the Oracle at Dodona
whether they should adopt the names which had come from
the Barbarians, the Oracle in reply bade them make use
of the names. From this time they sacrificed using the
names of the gods, and from the Pelasgians the Hellenes
afterwards received them: but whence the several gods had
their birth, or whether they all were from the beginning,
and of what form they are, they did not learn till yesterday,
as it were, or the day before: for Hesiod and Homer I
suppose were four hundred years before my time and not
more, and these are they who made a theogony for the
Hellenes and gave the titles to the gods and distributed to
them honours and arts‚ and set forth their forms: but the
poets who are said to have been before these men were
really in my opinion after them. Of these things the first
