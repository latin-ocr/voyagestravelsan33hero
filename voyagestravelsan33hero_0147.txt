THIRD VOYAGE 139

Our Captain willing to use those Negroes well (not'
hurting himself) set them ashore upon the Main, that they
might perhaps join themselves to their countrymen the
Cimaroons, and gain their liberty if they would; or if they
would not, yet by reason of the length and troublesomeness
of the way by land to Nombre de Dios, he might prevent
any notice of his coming, which they should be able to give.
For he was loath to put the town to too much charge (which
he knew they would willingly bestow) in providing before-
hand sor his entertainment; and therefore he hastened his
going thither, with as much speed and secrecy as possibly

To this end, disposing of all his companies, according as

his men, delivering them their several weapons and arms
which hitherto he had kept very fair and safe in good caske
[casks]: and exhorting them after his manner, he declared
“the greatness of the hope of good things that was there!
the weakness of the town, being unwalled! and the hope he
had of prevailing to recompense his wrongs! especially now
that he should come with such a creW, who were like-minded
with himself; and at such a time, as he should be utterly
undiscovered.”

Therefore, even that asternoon, he causeth us to set sail
for Nombre de Dios, so that before sunset we were as far
as Rio Francisco. Thence, he led us hard aboard the shore,
that we might not be descried of the Watch House, until
