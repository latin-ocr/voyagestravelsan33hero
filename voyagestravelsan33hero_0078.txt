of his kinsmen whom he lost by death. This king desiring
to surpass the kings of Egypt who had arisen before him left
as a memorial of himself a pyramid which he made of bricks‚
and on it there is an inscription carved in stone and saying
thus: ‘⁶ Despise not me in comparison with the pyramids of
stone, seeing that Ι excel them as much as Zeus excels the

Such were the deeds which this king performed: and after

and built with more cost, none more than this is a pleasure
to the eyes. Now Bubastis in the Hellenic tongue is
Artemis, and her temple is ordered thusz—Except the en-
trance it is completely surrounded by water3 for channels
come in from the Nile, not j0ining one another, but each
extending as far as the entrance of the temple, one flowing
round on the one side and the other on the other side, each
a hundred feet broad and shaded over with trees; and the
gateway has a height of ten fathoms‚ and it is adorned with
figures six cubits high, very noteworthy. This temple is in
