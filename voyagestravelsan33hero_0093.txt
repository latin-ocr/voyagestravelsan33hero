EGYPT 85

Pharbaithos, Thmuis, Onuphis, Anytis, Myecphoris,—-this
last is on an island opposite to the city of Bubastis. These
are the districts of the Calasirians; and they reached, when
most numerous, to the number of five-and-twenty myriads
of men; nor is it lawful for these, any more than for the
others, to practise any craft; but they practise that which
has to do with war only, handing down the tradition from 1
father to son. Now whether the Hellenes have learnt this
also from the Egyptians, 1 am not able to say for certain,
since I see that the Thracians also and Scythians and Per-

certain advantages in turn and not the same men twice;
that is to say, a thousand of the Calasirians and a thousand
of the Hermotybians acted as body-guard to the king during
each year; and these had besides their yokes of land an
allowance given them for each day of five pounds weight
of bread to each man, and two pounds of beef, and four
half—pints of wine. This was the allowance given to those
who were serving as the king’s body-guard for the time
being.

So when Apries leading his foreign mercenaries, and
Amasis at the head of the whole body of the Egyptians, in
their approach to one another had come to the city of Mo-
memphis, they engaged battle: and although the foreign
troops fought well, yet being much inferior in number they
were worsted by reason of this. But Apries is said to have
