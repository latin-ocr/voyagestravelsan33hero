ROUND THE WORLD 231

bad wind, and being amongst the islands‚ with much difficulty
we recovered to the northward of the island of Celebes;
where by reason of contrary winds, not able to continue our
course to run westwards, we were enforced to alter the same
to the southward again, finding that course also to be very
hard and dangerous for us, by reason of infinite shoals
which lie off and among the islands3 whereof we had too
much trial, to the hazard and danger of our ship and lives.
For, of all other days, upon the 9. of January, in the year
1579,²² we ran suddenly upon a rock, where we stuck fast
from eight of the clock at night till four of the clock in the
asternoon the next day, being indeed out of all hope to es-
cape the danger. But our General, as he had always hitherto
shewed himself courageous, and of a good confidence in the
mercy and protection of God, so now he continued in the
same. And lest he should seem to perish wilfully, both he
and we did our best endeavour to save ourselves; which it
pleased God so to bless, that in the end we cleared ourselves
most happily of the danger.

We lighted our ship upon the rocks of three ton of cloves,
eight pieces of ordnance, and certain meal and beans; and
then the wind, as it were in a moment by the special
grace of God, changing from the starboard to the larboard
of the ship, we hoised our sails, and the happy gale drove
our ship off the rock into the sea again, to the no little com-
fort of all our hearts, for which we gave God such praise
and thanks, as so great a benefit required.

The 8. of February following, we fell with the fruitful
island of Barateve‚²² having in the mean time suffered many
dangers by winds and shoals. The people of this island are
comely in body and stature, and of a civil behaviour, just in
dealing, and courteous to strangers; whereof we had the ex-
perience sundry ways, they being most glad of our presence,
and very ready to relieve our wants in those things which Α
their country did yield. The men go naked, saving their
heads and loins, every man having something or other
hanging at their ears. Their women are covered from the
middle down to the foot‚ wearing a great number of brace-
lets upon their arms; for some had eight upon each arm,
