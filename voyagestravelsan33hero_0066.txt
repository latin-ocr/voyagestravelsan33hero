58 HERODOTUS

and had taken away; and moreover they demanded satis-
faction for the wrongs done: and the Teucrians told the
same tale then and afterwards, both with oath and without
oath, namely that in deed and in truth they had not Helen
nor the wealth for which demand was made, but that both
were in Egypt; and that they could not justly be compelled
to give satisfaction for that which Proteus the king of
Egypt had. The Hellenes however thought that they were
being mocked by them and besieged the city, until at last
they took it; and when they had taken the wall and did not
find Helen, but heard the same tale as before, then they be-
lieved the former tale and sent Menelaos himself to Proteus.
And Menelaos having corne to Egypt and having sailed up
to Memphis, told the truth of these matters, and not only
found great entertainment, but also received Helen unhurt,
and all his own wealth besides. Then, however, after he had
been thus dealt with, Menelaos showed himself ungrateful
to the Egyptians; for when he set forth to sail away, con-
trary winds detained him, and as this condition of things
lasted long, he devised an impious deed; for he took two
children of natives and made sacrifice of them. After this,
when it was known that he had done so, he became ab·
horred‚ and being pursued he escaped and got away in his
ships to Libya; but whither he went besides after this, the
Egyptians were not able to tell. Of these things they said
that they found out part by inquiries, and the rest, namely
that which happened in their own land, they related from
sure and certain knowledge.

Thus the priests of the Egyptians told rne; and I myself
also agree with the story which was told of Helen, adding
this consideration, namely that if Helen had been in Ilion
she would have been given up to the Hellenes, whether
Alexander consented or n0; for Priam assuredly was not
so mad, nor yet the others of his house, that they were desir-
ous to run risk of ruin for themselves and their children
and their city, in order that Alexander might have Helen
as his wife: and even supposing that during the first part
of the time they had been so inclined, yet when many others
of the Trojans besides were losing their lives as often as
they fought with the Hellenes, and of the sons of Priam
