EGYPT 11

however, unless the river rises to sixteen cubits‚ or fifteen
at the least, it does not go over the land. I think too that
those Egyptians who dwell below the lake of Moiris and
especially in that region which is called the Delta, if that
land continues to grow in height according to this propor-
tion and to increase similarly in extent, will suffer for all
remaining time, from the Nile not overflowing their land,
that same thing which they themselves said that the Hel-
lenes would at some time suffer: sor hearing that the whole
land of the Hellenes has rain and is not watered by rivers
as theirs is, they said that the Hellenes would at some time
be disappointed of a great hope and would suffer the ills
of famine. This saying means that if the god shall not
send them rain, but shall allow drought to prevail for a long
time, the Hellenes will be destroyed by hunger; for they
have in fact no other supply of water to save them except
from Zeus alone. This has been rightly said by the Egyp-
tians with reference to the Hellenes: but now let me tell
how matters are with the Egyptians themselves in their turn.
If, in accordance with what I before said, their land below
Memphis (for this is that which is increasing) shall con-
tinue to increase in height according to the same proportion
as in the past time, assuredly those Egyptians who dwell
here will suffer famine, if their land shall not have rain
nor the river be able to go over their fields. It is certain
however that now they gather in fruit from the earth with
less labour than any other men and also with less than the
other Egyptians; for they have no labour in breaking up
furrows with a plough nor in hoeing nor in any other of
those labours which other men have about a cr0p; but when
the river has come up of itself and watered their fields and
after watering has left them again, then each man sows
his own field and turns into it swine‚ and when he has
trodden the seed into the ground by means of the swine‚
after that he waits for the harvest, and when he has
threshed the corn by means of the swine‚ then he gath-
ers it in.

If we desire to follow the opinions of the Ionians as re-
gards Egypt, who say that the Delta alone is Egypt, reckon-
ing its sea-coast to be from the watch-tower called ,of Peu-
