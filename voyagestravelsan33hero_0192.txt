his pistol towards him.

Upon this, they presently shot off their whole volley;
which, though it lightly wounded our captain, and divers
of our men, yet it caused death to one only of our company
called JOHN HARRIS‚ who was so powdered with hail-shot,
(which they all used for the most part as it seemed, or else
