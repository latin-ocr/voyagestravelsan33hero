and the spirit of prophecy. Neither do they disdain to
consult thern, nor neglect the responses which they return.
In the reign of the deified Vespasian, we have seen Veleda
for a long time, and by many nations, esteemed and adored
as a divinity. In times past they likewise worshipped
'Aurinia and several more, from no complaisance or effort
of flattery, nor as Deities of their own creating.

Of all the Gods5 Mercury is he whom they worship most.
To him on certain stated days it is lawful to offer even
human victims. Hercules and Mars they appease with
beasts usually allowed for sacrifice. Some of the Suevians
make likewise immolations to Isis. Concerning the cause
and original of this foreign sacrifice I have found small

If the chances have proved forbidding, they are no more
consulted upon the same affair during the same day: even
when they are inviting, yet, for confirmation, the faith of
auguries too is tried. Yea, here also is the known practice
of divining events from the voices and ssight of birds.
But to this nation it is peculiar, to learn presages and
admonitions divine from horses also. These are nourished
