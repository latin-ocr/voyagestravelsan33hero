32 HERODOTUS

Egyptians call all men Barbarians who do not agree with
them in speech. Thus having ceased from the work of the
channel‚ N ecos betook himself to waging wars, and triremes
were built by him, some for the Northern Sea and others
in the Arabian guli for the Erythraian Sea; and of these
the sheds are still to be seen„ These ships he used when he
needed them3 and also on land Nec5s engaged battle at
Magdolos with the Syrians, and conquered them; and
after this he took Cadytis, which is a great city of Syria:
and the dress which he wore when he made these con-
quests he dedicated to Apollo, sending it to Branchidai of
the Milesians. After this, having reigned in all sixteen years,
he brought his life to an end, and handed on the kingdom to
Psammis his son.

While this Psammis was king of Egypt, there came to him
men sent by the Eleians, who boasted that they ordered the
contest at Olympia in the most just and honourable manner
possible and thought that not even the Egyptians, the wisest
of men, could find out anything besides, to be added to their
rules. Now when the Eleians came to Egypt and said that
for which they had come, then this king called together
those of the Egyptians who were reputed the wisest‚ and
when the Egyptians had come together they heard the
Eleians tell of all that which it was their part to do in regard
to the contest; and when they had related everything, they
said that they had come to learn in addition anything which
the Egyptians might be able to find out besides, which was
juster than this. They then having consulted together asked
the Eleians whether their own citizens took part in the con-
test; and they said that it was permitted to any one who
desired it, both of their own people and of the other Hellenes
equally, to take part in the contest: upon which the Egyptians
said that in so ordering the games they had wholly missed
the mark of justiee; for it could not be but that they would
take part with the man of their own State, if he was con-
tending, and so act unfairly to the stranger: but if they
really desired, as they said, to order the games justly, and
if this was the cause for which they had come to Egypt, they
advised them to order the contest so as to be for strangers
alone to contend in, and that no Eleian should be permitted
