all their liberty. Immediately adjoining are the Rugians and
Lemovians upon the coast of the ocean, and of these several .
nations the characteristics are a round shield‚ a short sword
and kingly government. Next occur the communities of the
Suiones, situated in the ocean itself3 and besides their
strength in men and arms, very powert'ul at sea. The form
of their vessels varies thus far from ours, that they have
prows at each end, so as to be always ready to row to shore ¹
without turning nor are they rnoved by sails, nor on their
sides have benches of oars placed, but the rowers ply here
and there in all parts of the ship alike, as in some rivers is
done, and change their oars from place to place, just as they
shift their course hither or thither. To wealth also, amongst
them, great veneration is paid, and thence a single ruler
governs them, without all restriction of power, and exacting
unlimited obedience. Neither here, as amongst other nations
of Germany, are arms used indifferently by all, but shut
up and warded under the care of a particular keeper, who
in truth too is always a slave: since from all sudden in-
vasions and attacks from their foes, the ocean protects
them: besides that armed bands, when they are not em-
ployed, grow easily debauched and tumultuous. The truth
is, it suits not the interest of an arbitrary Prince, to trust
the care and power of arms either with a nobleman or with
a freeman, or indeed with any man above the condition of
a slave.

Beyond the Suiones is another sea, one very heavy and
almost void of agitation; and by it the whole globe is thought '
to be bounded and environed‚ for that the reflection of the
sun, after his setting, continues till his rising, so bright as
to darken the stars. To this, popular opinion has added,
that the tumult also οἱ his emerging from the sea is heard,
that forms divine are then seen, as likewise the rays about
his head. Only thus far extend the limits of nature, if
what fame says be true. Upon the right of the Suevian
Sea the AEstyan nations reside, who use the same customs
and attire with the Suevians; their language more resem-
bles that of Britain. They worship the Mother of the Gods.
As the characteristic of their national superstition, they
wear the images of wild boarS. This alone serves them
