head. The cats when they are dead are carried away to
sacred buildings in the city of Bubastis, where after being
embalmed they are buried; but the dogs they bury each
people in their own city in sacred tombs; and the ichneumons
are buried just in the same way as the dogs. The shrew—
mice however and the hawks they carry away to the city
of But0‚ and the ibises to Hermopolis3 the bears (which are
not commonly seen) and the wolves, not much larger in size
than foxes, they bury on the spot where they are found
lying.

Of the crocodile the nature is as follows t—during the four
most wintry months this creature eats nothing: she has four
feet and is an animal belonging to the land and the water
both3 for she produces and hatches eggs on the land, and
the most part of the day she remains upon dry land, but the
whole of the night in the river, for the water in truth is
warmer than the unclouded open air and the dew. Of all
the morta] creatures of which we have knowledge this grows
to the greatest bulk from the smallest beginning; for the
eggs which she produces are not much larger than those
of geese and the newly-hatched young one is in proportion
to the egg, but as he grows he becomes as much as seventeen
cubits long and sometimes yet larger. He has eyes like those
of a pig and teeth large and tusky, in proportion to the size
of his body; but unlike all other beasts he grows no tongue‚ .
neither does he move his lower jaw, but brings the upper
jaw towards the lower, being in this too unlike all other
beasts. He has moreover strong claws and a scaly hide upon
his back which cannot be pierced3 and he is blind in the
water, but in the air he is of a very keen sight. Since he has
his living in the water he keeps his mouth all full within of
leeches; and whereas all other birds and beasts fly from him,
the trochilus is a creature which is at peace with him, seeing
that from her he receives benefit; for the crocodile having
come out of the water to the land and then having opened his
mouth (this he is wont to do generally towards the West
wind), the trochilus upon that enters into his mouth and
swallows down the leeches‚ and he being benefited is pleased
and does no harm to the trochilus. Now for some of the
Egyptians the crocodiles are sacred animals, and for others
