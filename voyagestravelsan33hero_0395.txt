DISCOVERY OF GUIANA 387

which riseth on Paria side towards C amanei, and that river
is inhabited with the Wikiri, whose chief town upon the
said river is Sayma. In this bay there are no more rivers
but these three before rehearsed and the four branches of
Amana, all which in the winter thrust so great abundance of
water into the sea, as the same is taken up fresh two or three
leagues from the land. In the passages towards Gaiana,
that is, in all those lands which the eight branches of
Orenoque fashion into islands, there are but one sort of
people, called Tivitivas, but of two castes, as they term thern,
the one called Ciawani, the other Waraweeti, and those war
one with another. ,

On the hithermost part of Ormoque, as at Toparimaca
and Winicapora, those are of a nation called Nepoios‚ and
are the followers of Campana, lord of Emeria. Between
Wim'capora and the port of M orequim, which standeth in
Ammaia, and all those in the valley of Amariocapana are
called Orenoqueponi‚and did obey M ore-quito and are now fol-
lowers of Topiawari. Upon the river ot* Caroli are the Ca-
nuri, which are governed by a woman who is inheritrix οἱ
that province ; who carne far off to see our nation‚ and asked
me divers questions of her Majesty‚ being much delighted
with the discourse of her Majesty’s greatness, and wonder-
ing at such reports as we truly made of her Highness’ many
virtues. And upon the head of Caroli and on the lake of
Cassipa are the three strong nations of the Cassipagotos.
Right south into the land are the Caparepani and Empare-
pani, and beyond those, adjoining to Macureguarai, the first
city of Iuga, are the [warawakeri. All these are professed
enemies to the Spaniards, and to the rich Epuremei also. To
the west of Caroli are divers nations of Cannibals and of
those Ewaipanoma without heads. Directly west are the
Amapaias and Anebas, which are also marvellous rich in
gold. The rest-towards Peru we will omit. On the north ot*
Orenoque, between it and the West Indies, are the Wikiri,
Saymi, and the rest before spoken of, all mortal enemies to
the Spaniards, On the south side οἱ the main mouth of Ore-
noque are the Arwacas‚· and beyond them, the Cannibals,·
and to the south of them, the Amazons.
