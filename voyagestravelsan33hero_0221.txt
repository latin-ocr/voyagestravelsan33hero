ROUND THE WORLD 213

have a care of such ships as were absent; and therefore
endeavouring to seek the fly-boat wherein Master Doughty
waS, we espied her again the next day. And whereas certain
of our ships were sent to discover the coast and to search an
harbour, the Marigold and the canter being employed in that
business, came unto us and gave us understanding of a safe
harbour that they had found. Wherewith all our ships
bare, and entered it; where we watered and made new
provision of victuals‚ as by seals, whereof we slew to the
number of 200 or 300 in the space of an hour. Here our
General in the Admiraz rid close aboard the fly—boat, and
took out of her all the provision of victuals and what else
was in her, and hauling her to the land, set fire to her, and so
burnt her to save the iron work. Which being a-doing, there
came down of the country certain of the people naked, sav-
ing only about their waist the skin of some beast‚ with the
fur or hair on, and something also wreathed on their heads.
Their faces were painted with divers colours‚ and some of
thern had on their heads the similitude of horns, every man
his bow, which was an ell in length, and a couple of arrOWS.
They were very agile people and quick to deliver, and
seemed not to be ignorant in the feats of wars, as by their
order of ranging a few men might appear. These people
would not of a long time receive anything at our hands;
yet at length our General being ashore, and they· dancing
after their accustomed manner about him, and he once
turning his back towards them, one leaped suddenly to him,
and took his cap with his gold band off his head, and ran a
little distance from him, and shared it with his fellow, the
cap to the one, and the band to the other. Having despatched
all our business in this place, we departed and set sail. And
immediately upon our setting forth we lost our canter, which
was absent three of four days; but when our General had
her again, he took out the necessaries, and so gave her over,
near to the Cape of Good Hope. The next day after, being
the 20. of June, we harboured ourselves again in a very good
harborough‚ called by Magellan, Ρονιι St. Julian, where we
found a gibbet standing upon the main; which we supposed
to be the place where Magellan did execution upon some of
his disobedient and rebellious company.
