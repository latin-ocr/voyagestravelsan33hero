DRAKE’S GREAT ARMADA

Nmm five years elapsed between Drake's return from his
Famous Voyage and the despatch of the formidable armament
commemorated in the following pages. During the last of these
years the march of events had been remarkably rapid. Gilbert,
who had been empowered by Elizabeth, in the year of Frobisher’s
last expedition, to found colonies in America, had sailed for that
purpose to Newfoundland (1583), and had perished at sea on
his way homeward. Raleigh, who had succeeded to his half-
brother's enterprises‚ had despatched his exploring expedition to
‘Virginia‚' under Amadas and Barlow, in 1584, and had followed
it up in the next year (1585) by an actual colony. In April Sir
Richard Greenville sailed from Plymouth, and at Raleigh’s ex-
pense established above a hundred colonists on the island of
Roanoak. Drake’s Great Armada left Plymouth in September of
the same year. It marked a turning-point in the relations between
the English and Spanish monarchs. Elizabeth‚ knowing that the
suppression of the insurrection in the Netherlands would be fol-
lowed by an attack upon England, was treating with the insur-
gents. Philip deemed it prudent to lay an embargo on all her
subjects‚ together with their ships and goods, that might be
found in his dominions. Elizabeth at once authorized general
reprisals on the ships and goods of Spaniards. A company of
adventurers was quickly formed for taking advantage of this per-
mission on a scale commensurate with the national resources.
They equipped an armada of twenty-five vessels, manned by 2,300
men, and despatched it under the command of Drake to plunder
Spanish America. Frobisher was second in command. Two-
thirds of the booty were to belong to the adventurers3 the re-
maining third was to be divided among the men employed in the
expedition.

Drake’s armament of 1585 was the greatest that had ever
crossed the Atlantic. After plundering some vessels at the Vigo
river, he sailed for the West Indies by way of the Canaries and
Cape Verde Islands, hoisted the English flag over Santiago and
