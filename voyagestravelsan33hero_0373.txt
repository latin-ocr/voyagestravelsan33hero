DISCOVERY OF GUIANA 365

And so I will return again to our journey, which for this
third day we finished, and cast anchor again near the con-
tinent on the left hand between two mountains, the one
called Aroami and the other Aio. I made no stay here but
till midni-ght; for I feared hourly lest any rain should fall,
and then it had been impossible to have gone any further
up, notwithstanding that there is every day a very strong
breeze and easterly wind. I deferred the search of the

borderers, with many women and children, that came to
wonder at our nation and to bring us down victual, which
they did in great plenty, as venison, pork, hens, chickens,
fowl‚ fish, with divers sorts of excellent fruits and roots‚ and
great abundance of pinas, the princess of fruits that grow
