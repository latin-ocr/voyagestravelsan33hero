ROUND THE WORLD 265

And in their running thus away, the Sergeant-Major finding
one of their horses ready saddled and bridled, took the same
to follow the chase; and so overgoing all his company, was
by one laid behind a bush shot through the head ; and falling
down therewith, was by the same and two or three more,
stabbed in three or four places of his body with swords and
daggers, before any could come near to his rescue. His
death was much lamented‚ being in very deed an honest
wise gentleman, and soldier of good experience, and of as
great courage as any man might be.

In this place called St. 'Augustine we understood the king
did keep, as is before said, 150 soldiers, and at another place
some dozen leagues beyond to the northwards, called St.
Helena, he did there likewise keep 150 more, serving there

When we came thwart of St. Helena, the shoals appearing
dangerous, and we having no pilot to undertake the entry,
it was thought meetest to go hence alongst. For the Ad-
miral had been the same night in four fathom and a half,
three leagues from the shore; and yet we understood, by
the help of a known pilot, there may and do go in ships of
greater burden and draught than any we had in our fleet.
We passed thus along the coast hard aboard the shore, which
is shallow for a league or two from the shore, and the same
is low and broken land for the most part. The ninth of
June upon sight of one special great fire (which are very
ordinary all alongst this coast, even from the Cape of
Florida hither) the General sent his skiff to the shore, where
they found some of our English countrymen that had been
