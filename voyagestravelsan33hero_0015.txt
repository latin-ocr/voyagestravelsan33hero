EGYPT 7

1 shall record only because I am compelled by the course
of the story. But as to those matters which concern men,
the priests agreed with one another in saying that the
Egyptians were the first of all men on earth to find out
the course of the year, having divided the seasons into
twelve parts to make up the whole; and this they said they
found out from the stars: and they reckon to this extent
more wisely than the Hellenes, as it seems to me, inasmuch
as the Hellenes throw in an intercalated month every other
year, to make the seasons right, whereas the Egyptians,
reckoning the twelve months at thirty days each, bring in
also every year five days beyond the number, and thus the
circle of their seasons is completed and comes round to
the same point whence it set out. They said moreover that
the Egyptians were the first who brought into use appella-
tions for the twelve gods and the Hellenes took up the use
from them; and that they were the first who assigned altars
and images and temples to the gods, and who engraved fig-
ures on stones; and with regard to the greater number of
these things they showed me by actual facts that they had
happened so. They said also that the first man who became
king of Egypt was Min; and that in his time all Egypt ex—
cept the district of Thebes was a swamp, and none of the
regions were then above water which now lie below the lake
of Moiris, to which lake it is a voyage of seven days up the
river from the sea: and Ι thought that they said well about
the land; for it is manifest in truth even to a person who
has not heard it beforehand but has only seen, at least if
he have understanding‚ that the Egypt to which the Hellenes
come in ships is a land which has been won by the Egyptians
as an addition, and that it is a gift of the river: moreover
the regions which lie above this lake also for a distance of
three days' sail, about which they did not go on to say any-
thing of this kind, are nevertheless another instance of the
same thing: for the nature of the land of Egypt is as fol-
lowsx—-First when you are still approaching it in a ship and
are distant a day's run from the land, if you let down a
sounding-line you will bring up mud and you will find your-
self in eleven fathoms. This then so far shows that there
is a silting forward of the land. Then second1y‚ as to Egypt
