ROUND THE WORLD 261

bour water-side, the same being walled with a wall of stone;
which we told the Spaniards was yet curs, and not redeemed
by their composition. Whereupon they, finding the defect
of their contract, were contented to enter into another
ransom for all places, but specially for the said house, as
also the blockhouse or castle‚ which is upon the mouth
of the inner harbour. And when we asked as much for
the one as for the other, they yielded to give a thousand
crowns for the abbey, leaving us to take our pleasure upon

having stretched themselves to the uttermost of their

great that her men were all tired with pumping. But at the
last, having found her, and the bark Talbot in her company,
which stayed by great hap with her, they were ready to
take their men out of her for the saving of them. And so
the GeneraL being fully advertised of their great extremity‚
made sail directly back again to Carthagena with the whole
fleet; where, having staid eight or ten days more about the
