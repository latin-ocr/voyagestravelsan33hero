340 SIR WALTER RALEIGH

of those helps which our goldsmiths have to work withal.
The particular name of the people in Amapaia which gave
him these pieces, are called Anebas, and the river of
Orenoque at that place is about twelve English miles broad,
which may be from his outfall into the sea 700 or 800 miles.

This province of Amapaia is a very low and a marish
ground near the river3 and by reason of the red water which
issueth out in small branches thorough the fenny and boggy
ground, there breed divers poisonful worms and serpents.
And the Spaniards not suspecting‚ nor in any sort fore-
knowing the danger, were infected with a grievous kind of
flux by drinking thereos, and even the very horses poisoned
‘cherewith3 insomuch as at the end of the six months that they
abode there, of all their troops there were not left above 120
soldiers‚ and neither horse nor cattle. For Berreo hoped to
have found Gaiana by 1,ooo miles nearer than it fell out to
be in the end ; by means whereof they sustained much want,
and much hunger, oppressed with grievous diseases, and all
the miseries that could be imagined, Ι demanded of those in
Guiana that had travelled Amapaia, how they lived with that
tawny or red water when they travelled thither3 and they
told me that after the sun was near the middle of the sky,
they used to fill their pots and pitehers with that water, but
either before that time or towards the setting of the sun it
was dangerous to drink of, and in the night strong poison.
Ι learned also of divers other rivers of that nature among
them, which were also, while the sun was in the meridian,
very saie to drink, and in the morning, evening, and night,
wonderful dangerous and infective. From this province
Berreo hasted away as soon as the spring and beginning of
summer appeared, and sought his entrance on the borders of
Orenoque on the south side; but there ran a ledge of so high
and impassable mountains, as he was not able by any means
to march over them, continuing from the east sea into which
Orenoque falleth, even to Quito in Peru. Neither had he
means to carry victual or munition over those craggy, high,
and fast hills, being all woody‚ and those so thick and spiny,
and so full of prickles‚ thorns, and briars, as it is impossible
to creep thorough them. He had also neither friendship
among the people, nor any interpreter to persuade or treat
