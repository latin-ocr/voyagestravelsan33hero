158 SIR FRANCIS DRAKE

ready to assist and favour his enterprises against his and
their enemies to the uttermost: and to that end their
captain and company did stay at this present near the mouth
of Rio Diego, to attend what answer and order should be
given them; that they would have marched by land, even to
this place, but that the way is very long, and more trouble-
sorne, by reason of many steep mountains‚ deep rivers, and
thick brakes: desiring therefore, that it might please our
Captain to take some order, as he thought best, with all

Our Captain considering the speech of these persons,

a great many of goodly islands full of trees, W here, though
there be channels, yet there are such rocks and shoals‚ that

day without discovery, whereas our ships might lie hidden
within the trees.

The next day (14th September) we arrived at this river
appointed, where we found the Cimaroons according to
promise: the rest of their number were a mile up, in a wood
by the river's side. There after we had given them enter-
