208 DRAKE’S FAMOUS VOYAGE

Camiri, upon the coast of Barbar3r; and coasting along, the
27. day we found an island called Mogador, lying one mile
distant from the main. Between which island and the
main we found a very good and safe harbour for our ships
to ride in, as also very good entrance, and void of any danger.
On this island our General erected a pinnace, whereof he
brought out of England with him four already framed.
While these things were in doing, there carne to the water’s
side some of the inhabitants of the country, shewing forth
their flags of truce; which being seen of ourGeneral, he
sent his ship’s boat to the shore to know what they would.
They being willing to come aboard‚ our men left there one
man of our company for a pledge, and brought two of theirs
aboard our ship; which by signs shewed our General that the
next day they would bring some provision, as sheep, caponS,
and hens, and such like. Whereupon our General bestowed
amongst them some linen eloth and shoes, and a javelin,
which they very joyfully received, and departed for that
time. The next morning they failed not to come again to
the water’s side. And our General again setting out our
boat, one of our men leaping over-rashly ashore, and offer-
ing friendly to embrace them, they set violent hands on him,
offering a dagger to his throat if he had made any resistance;
and so laying him on a horse carried him away. So that a man
cannot be too circumspect and wary of himself among such
misereants. Our pinnace being finished, we departed from
this place the 30. and last day of December, and coasting
along the shore we did descry, not contrary to our expecta-
tion, certain canters, which were Spanish fishermen? to
whom we gave chase and took three of them. And proceed-
ing further we met with three carvels, and took them also.
The 17. day of January we arrived at Cape Blanco, where
we found a ship riding at anchor, within the Cape, and
but two simple mariners in her. Which ship we took and
carried her further into the harbour, where we remained
four days ; and in that space our General mustered and
trained his men on land in warlike manner, to make them
fit for all occasions. In this place we took of the fishermen
such necessaries as we wanted, and they could yield us;
