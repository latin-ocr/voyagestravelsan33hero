THIRD VOYAGE 141

given over night, to such as he had made choice of for the
purpose, left twelve to keep the pinnaces; that we might be
sure of a safe retreat, if the worst befell. And having
made sure work of the Platform before he would enter
the town, he thought best, first to view the Mount on the
east side of the town: where he was informed, by sundry
intelligences the year before, they had an intent to plant
ordnance, which might scour round about the town.

Therefore‚ leaving one half of his company to make a
stand at the foot of the Mount‚ he marched up presently
unto the top of it, with all speed to try the truth of the
report, for the more safety. There we found no pieee of
ordnance‚ but only a very fit place prepared for such use,
and therefore we left it without any of our men, and with
all celerity returned now down the Mount.

Then our Captain appointed his brother, with JOHN
ΟΧΝΑΜ [ον OXENHAM] and sixteen other of his men, to go
about, behind the King’s Treasure House, and enter near
the easter[n] end of the Market Place: himself with the
rest, would pass up the broad street into the Market
place, with sound of drum and trumpet. The Firepikes,
divided half to the one, and half to the other company,
served no less for fright to the enemy than light of our
men, who by his means might discern every place very
well, as if it were near day: whereas the inhabitants stood
amazed at so strange a sight, marvelling what the matter
might be, and imagining, by reason of our drums and trum-
pets sounding in so sundry places, that we had been a far
, greater number then we were.

Yet, by means of the soldiers of which were in the town,
and by reason of the time which we spent in marching up
and down the Mount‚ the soldiers and inhabitants had put
themselves in arms, and brought their companies in some
order, at the south-east end of the Market Place, near the
Governor’s House, and not far from the gate of the town,
which is the only one, leading towards Panama: having
(as it seems) gathered themselves thither, either that in
the Governor's sight they might shew their valour, if it
might prevail; or else, that by the gate they might best
take their Vale, and escape readiest.
