140 SIR FRANCIS DRAKE

that being come within two leagues of the point of the hay,
he caused us to strike a hull, and cast our grappers [grap-
pling irons]‚ riding so until it was dark night.

Then we weighed again, and set sail, rowing hard aboard
the shore, with as much silence as we could, till we recovered
the point of the harbour under the high land. There, we
stayed, all silent ; purposing to attempt the town in the
dawning of the day: after that we had reposed ourselves,
for a while.

But our Captain with some other of his best men, finding
that our people were talking of the greatness of the town,
and what their strength might be; especially by the report

although we found one gunner upon the Platt'orm [battery]
in the very place where we landed; being a sandy place and
no key [quay] at all, not past twenty yards from the houses.

There we found six great pieces of brass ordnance,
mounted upon their carriages, some Demy, some Whole-
Culvering.

We presently dismounted thern. The gunner fied. The
town took alarm (being very ready thereto, by reason of
their often disquieting by their near neighbours the Cima—
roons) 3 as we perceived, not only by the noise and cries of
the people‚ but by the bell ringing out, and drums running
up and down the town.

Our Captain‚ according to the directions which he had
