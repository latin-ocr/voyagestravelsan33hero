114 TACITUS

¹house to inhabst, no land to cultivate, nor any domestic charge
or care. With whomsoever they come to sojourn, by him
they are maintained; always very prodigal of the substance
of others, always despising what is their own, till the feeble-
ness of old age overtakes them, and renders them unequal
to the efforts of such rigid bravery.

Next to the Cattans‚ dwell the Usipians and Tencterians;
upon the Rhine now running in a charmel uniform and cer-
tain, such as suffices for a boundary. The Tencterians, be-
sides their wonted glory in war, surpass in the service and
discipline of their cavalry. Nor do the Cattans derive
higher applause from their foot, than the Tencterians from
their horse. Such was the order established by their fore-
fathers, and what their posterity still pursue. From riding
and exercising of horses, their children borrow their pas-
times; in this exercise the young men find matter for emu-
lating one another, and in this the old men take pleasure to
persevere. Horses are by the father bequeathed as part of
his household and family, horses are conveyed amongst the
rights of succession, and as such the son receives them; but
not the eldest son, like other effects, by priority of birth, but
he who happens to be signal in boldness and superior in war.

Contiguous to the Tencterians formerly dwelt the Bruc-
terians, in whose room it is said the Chamavians and Angri-
varians are now settled; they who expulsed and almost ex-
tirpated the Bructerians‚ with the concurrence of the neigh-
bouring nations: whether in detestation of: their arrogance,
or allured by the love of spoil, or through the special favour
of the Gods towards us Romans. They in truth even vouch-
safed to gratify us with the sight of the battle. In it there
fell above sixty thousand souls, without a blow struck by
the Romans; but, what is a circumstance still more glorious,
fell to furnish them with a spectacle of joy and recreation.
May the Gods continue and perpetuate amongst these na-
fions, if not any love for us, yet by all means this their
animosity and hate towards each other: since whilst the
destiny of the Empire thus urges it, fortune cannot more
signally befriend uS, than in sowing strife amongst our foes.
