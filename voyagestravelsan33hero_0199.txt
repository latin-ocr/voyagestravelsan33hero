ΤΗ IRD VOYAGE 191

perfectly‚ so that he could enter by night safely without
danger of the sands and shallows, though there be but little
water, and utterly undescried; for that the town is five
leagues within the harbour, and the way by land is so far
about and difficult through the woods, that though we should
by any casualty be discovered, about the point of the har·
bour, yet we might despatch our business and depart, before
the town could have notice of our coming.

At his being there, he perceived they had heard of DRAKE’S
being on the coast, which had put them in great sear, as in
all other places (PEzoRo purposing to remove himself to the
South Sea!): but there was nothing done to prevent him,
their sear being so great, that, as it is accustomed in such
cases, it excluded counsel and bred despair.

Our Captain‚ conferring with his own knowledge and
former intelligences, was purposed to have returned to his

But when the Genoese Pilot was very earnest‚ to have the

standing.

But when we were come to the mouth of the harbour, we
heard the report of two Chambers, and farther off about a
league within the bay, two other as it were answering them:
whereby the Genoese Pilot conjectured that we were dis-
covered: for he assured us, that this order had been taken
since his last being there, by reason of the advertisernent
and charge, which the Governor of Panama had sent to all
the Coasts; which even in their beds lay in great and con-
tinual sear of our Captain, and therefore by all likelihood,
maintained‘this kind of watch, at the charge of the rich
Gnuffe PEzono for their security.

Thus being defeated of this expectation, we found it was
not GOD’S will that we should enter at that time: the rather
