388 SIR WALTER RALEIGH

flowers, gums‚ sweet woods, and of their several religions
and customs‚ would for the first require as many volumes as
those of Gesnerus, and for the next another bundle of De·
cades, The religion of the Epuremei is the same which the
Ing-as, emperors of Peru, used, which may be read in Cieza
and other Spanish stories; how they believe the immortality
of the soul, worship the sun, and bury with thern alive their
best beloved wives and treasure, as they likewise do in Pegu
in the East Indices, and other places. The Orenoqueponi bury
not their wives with them, but their jewels, hoping to enjoy
them again. The Arwacas dry the bones of their lords, and
their wives and friends drink them in powder. In the graves
of the Peruvians the Spaniards found their greatest abun-
dance of treasure. The like, also, is to be found among
these people in every province. They have all many wives,
and the lords five-sold to the common sort. Their wives
never eat with their husbands‚ nor among the men, but serve
their husbands at meals and afterwards seed by thern-
selves. Those that are past their younger years make all
their bread and drink, and work their cotton-beds, and
do all else of service and labour; for the men do nothing
but hunt, fish, play, and drink, when they are out of the
warS.

I will enter no further into discourse of their manners,
laws‚ and customs. And because I have not myself seen
the cities of Inga Ι cannot avow on my credit what I have
heard, although it be very likely that the emperor Inga hath
built and erected as magnificent palaces in Gm‘ana as his
ancestors did in Peru,· which were for their riches and rare-
ness most marvellous, and exceeding all in Europe, and, I
think, of the world, C hina excepted, which also the Spaniards,
, which Ι had, assured me to be true, as also the nations of
the bordererS, who, being but savages to those of the inland,
do cause much treasure to be buried with them. For Ι was
ι informed of one of the caciques of the valley of Amarioca-
pana which had buried with him a little before our arrival
a chair of gold most curiously wrought, which was made
either in Macureguarai adjoining or in Mmzoa. But if we
should have grieved thern in their religion at the first, before
they had been taught better, and have digged up their grave5‚
