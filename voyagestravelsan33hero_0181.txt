THIRD VOYAGE 173

come in his name with any tokens‚ unless he brought his
handwriting: which he knew could not be counterfeited by
the Cimaroons or Spaniards.

We were in all forty-eight, of which eighteen only were
English; the rest were Cimaroons, which beside their arim,
bare every one of them, a great quantity of victuals
and provision, supplying our want of carriage in so long a
march, so that we were not troubled with anything but
om· furniture. And because they could not carry enough
to suffice us altogether; therefore (as they promised before)
so by the way with their arrows, they provided for us com-
petent store from time to time.

They have every one of them two sorts of arrows: the
one to defend himself and offend the enemy, the other to
kill his victuals. These for fight are somewhat like the
Scottish arrow; only somewhat longer, and headed with
iron, wood, or fish bones. But the arrows for provision are
of three sorts, the first serveth to kill any great beast near
[at] hand, as ox, stag, or wild boar: this hath a head of iron
of a pound and a half weight‚ shaped in form like the head
of a javelin or boat-spear, as sharp as any knife, making
so large and deep a wound as can hardly be believed of
him that hath not seen it. The second serveth for lesser
beasts, and hath a head of three-quarters of a pound: this
he most usually shooteth. The third serveth for all manner
of birds: it hath a head of an ounce weight. And these
heads though they be of iron only, yet are they so cun-
ningly tempered, that they will continue a very good edge
a long time: and though they be turned sometimes, yet they
will never or seldom break. The necessity in which they
stand hereof continually causeth them to have iron in far
greater account than gold: and no man among them is of
greater estimation, than he that can most perfectly give
this temper unto it.

Every day we were marching by sun-rising. We con-
tinued till ten in the forenoon: then resting (ever near some
river) till past twelve, we marched till four, and then by
some river’s side, we reposed ourselves in such houses, as
either we found prepared heretofore by them, when they
