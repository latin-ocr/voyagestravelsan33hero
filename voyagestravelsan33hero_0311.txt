ΤΟ NEWFOUNDLAND ³03

sundry discourses touching affairs past and to come, lament-
‘mg greatly the loss of his great ship, more of the men, but
most of all his books and noteS, and what else I know not,
for which he was out of measure grieved, the same doubtless
being some matter of more importance than his books, which
Ι could not draw from him: yet by circumstance I gathered
the same to be the ore which Daniel the Saxon had brought
unto him in the Newfoundland. W'hatsoever it was, the re-
membrance touched him so deep as, not able to contain him-
seli, he beat his boy in great rage, even at the same time,
so long after the miscarrying of the great ship‚ because upon
a fair day, when we were becalmed upon the coast of the

made suit for, offering to employ their money and travail
upon the same yet neither by their own suit, nor of others
of his own company, whom he seemed willing to pleasure‚
it could be obtained. Also laying down his determination
in the spring following for disposing of his voyage then to
be re-attempted: he assigned the captain and master of the
Golden Hind unto the south discovery, and reserved unto
himself the north, affirming that this voyage had won his
heart from the south, and that he was now become a north-
ern man altogether.

Last, being demanded what means he had, at his arrival
in England, to compass the charges of so great preparation
as he intended to make the next spring, having determined
upon two fleets, one for the south, another for the north;
