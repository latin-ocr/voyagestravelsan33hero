148 SIR FRANCIS DRAKE

would, by means of the Cimaroons, whom though he had
betrayed divers times (being used thereto by his Masters)
so that he knew they would kill him, if they got him: yet
if our Captain would undertake his protection, he durst
adventure his life, because he knew our Captain’s name was
most precious and highly honoured by thern.

This report ministered occasion to further consultation:
for which, because this place seemed not the safest; as
being neither the healthiest nor quietest; the next day, in
the morning, we all set our course for the Isle of Pinos ,or
Port Plenty, where we had left our ships, continuing all
that day, and the next till towards night, before we re-
covered it.

We were the longer in this course, for that our Captain
sent away his brother and ELL1s H1xoM to the westward,
to search the River of Chagres, where himself had been
the year before, and yet was careful to gain more notice of;

sea, and so to Nombre de Dios.

It ebbeth and floweth not far into the land, and therefore

[up] from the mouth to Venta Cruz; but one day and a
night serveth to return down the river.

At our return to our ships (Ist August), in our consulta-
tion, Captain RANSE (forecasting divers doubts of our safe
continuance upon that coast, being now discovered) was
willing to depart; and our Captain no less willing to dis-
miss him: and therefore as soon as our pinnaces returned
from Chagres (7th August) with such advertisement as
they were sent for, about eight days before; Captain RANSE
took his leave, leaving us at the isle aforesaid, where we
had remained five or six days.

In which meantime, having put all things in a readiness,
our Captain resolved, with his two ships and three pinnaces
to go to Cartagena; whither in sailing, we spent some six
days by reason of the calms which came often upon us:
