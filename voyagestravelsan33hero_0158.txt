150 SIR FRANCIS DRAKE

board side, forthwith boarded her ; though we had some
difficulty to enter by reason of her height, being of 240 tons.
But as soon as we entered upon the decks‚ we threw down
the grates and spardecks, to prevent the Spaniards from
annoying us with their close fights: who then perceiving
that we were possessed of their ship, stowed themselves
all in hold with their weaponS, except two or three yonkers,
which were found afore the beetes: when having light
out of our pinnaces, we found no danger of the enemy
remaining, we cut their cables at halse, and with our three
pinnaces‚ towed her without the island into the sound right

some blessed shot, by all likelihood he had sacked it. He
was yet still upon the coast; they should therefore carefully

After that our Captain had brought all his fleet together,
at the Scrivanos’ entreaties, he was content to do them
all favour, in setting them and all their companies on shore ;
and so bare thence with the islands of St. Bernards‚ about
three leagues of the town: where we found great store of
fish for our refreshing.

Here, our Captain considering that he was now discovered
upon the chieftest places of all the coast, and yet not mean-
ing to leave it till he had found the Cimaroons, and “ made '¹
his voyage, as he had conceived; which would require some
