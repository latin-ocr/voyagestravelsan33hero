EGYPT 21

over reason compels us to think so; for the Nile flows from
Libya and cuts Libya through in the midst, and as I con-
jecture, judging of what is not known by that which is
evident to the view, it starts at a distance from its mouth
equal to that of the Ister: for the river Ister begins from the
Keltoi and the city of Pyrene and so runs that it divides
Europe in the midst (now the Keltoi are outside the
Pillars of Heracles and border upon the Kynesians, who
dwell furthest towards the sunset of all those who have
their dwelling in Europe); and the Ister ends, having its
course through the whole of Europe, by flowing into the
Euxine Sea at the place where the Milesians have their
settlement of Istria. Now the Ister, since it flows through
land which is inhabited‚ is known by the reports of many;
but of the sources of the Nile no one can give an account,
for the part of Libya through which it flows is uninhabited
and desert. About its course however so much as it was
possible to Iearn by the most diligent inquiry has been
told ; and it runs out into Egypt. Now Egypt lies nearly
opposite to the mountain districts of Kilikia3 and from thence
to Sinope, which lies upon the Euxine Sea, is a journey
in the same straight line of five days for a man with-
out encumbrance3 and Sinope lies opposite to the place where
the Ister runs out into the sea: thus I think that the Nile
passes through the whole of Libya and is of equal measure
with the Ister.

of the Nile then let so much suffice as has been said.
Of Egypt however I shall make my report at length, be-
cause it has wonders more in number than any other land,
and works too it has to show as much as any land, which
are beyond expression great: for this reason then more
shall be said concerning it.

The Egyptians in agreement with their climate, which
is unlike any other, and with the river, which shows a
nature different from all other rivers, established for them-
selves manners and customs in a way opposite to other men
in almost all matters: for among them the women fre-
quent the market and carry on trade, while the men remain
at home and weavej and whereas others weave pushing the
