INTRODUCTORY NOTE

S1R FRANCIS DRAKE, the yreatest of the naval adventurers of
Enyland of the time of Elizabeth, was born in Devonshire about
1540. He went to sea early, was sailiny to the Spanish Main by
1565, and commanded a ship under Hawkins in an expedition that
was overwhelmed by the Spaniards in 1567. In order to recom-
pense himself for the loss suffered in this disaster, he equipped
the expedition ayainst the Spanish treasure-house at Nombre de
Dios in 1572, the fortunes of which are described in the first of
the two following] narratives. It was on this voyaye that he was
led by native yuides to “that yoodly and great hiyh tree” on the
isthmus of Dorien, from which, first of Enylislzmen, he looked
on the Pacific, and “besonyht Almiyhty God of His ‚qoodness to
give him life and leave to sail once in an Enylish ship in thatsea.’'

The fulfilment of this prayer is described in the second of the
voyayes here printed, in which it is told how, in 1578, Drake
passed throuyh the Straits of Mayellan into waters never before
sailed by his countrymen, and with a sinyle ship rifled the Spanish
settlements on the west coast of South America and plundered
the Spanislz treasure-ships,· how, consideriny it unsafe to 90 back
the way he came lest the enemy should seek revenye, he went as
far north as the Golden Gate, then passed across the Pacific and
round by the Cape of Good Hope, and so home, the first English-
man to circuninaviyate the ylobe. Only Mayellan's ship had pre—
ceded him in the feat, and Mayellan had died on the voyaye. The
Qneen visited the ship, “lee Golden Hind,” as she lay at Dept-
ford and kniyhted the commander on board.

Drake’s further adventures were of almost eqnal interest. Re-
turniny from a raid on the Spaniards in 1586, he brouyht home
the despairiny Viryinian colony, and is said at the same tiene to
have introduced from America tobacco and potatoes. Two years
later he led the Enqlish fieet in the decisive enyayenzent with the
Great Armada. In 1595 he set out on another voyaye to the
Spanish Main,· and in the Ianuary of the followiny year died
off Porto Bello and was buried in the waters where he had made
his name as the greatest seaman of his day and nation.
