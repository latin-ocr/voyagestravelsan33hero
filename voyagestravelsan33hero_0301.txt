wholesome to eat. The grass and herb doth fat sheep in
very short space, proved by English merchants which have
carried sheep thither for fresh victual and had them raised
exceeding fat in less than three weeks. Peasen which our
countrymen have sown in the time of May, have corne up
fair, and been gathered in the beginning of August, of which
our General had a present acceptable for the rareness‚ being
the first fruits coming up by art and industry in that desolate
