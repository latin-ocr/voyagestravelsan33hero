THIRD VOYAGE 201

Rio Grande [Magdazena] passed hard by us, bearing also
but small sail. We saluted them with our shot and arrows,
they answered us with bases; but we got aboard them, and
took such order, that they were content against their wills
to depart ashore and to leave us this frigate: which was of
25 tons, loaded with maize‚ hens, and hogs, and some honey,
in very good time fit for our use; for the honey especially
was notable reliever and preserver of our crazed [sick]
people.

The next morning as soon as we set those Spaniards
ashore on the Main, we set our course for the Cabecas with-
out any stop, whither we came about five days after. And
being at anchor, presently we hove out all the maize a land,
saving three butts which we kept for our store: and carry-
ing all our provisions ashore, we brought both our frigates
on the careen, and new tallowed them.

Here we stayed about seven nights, trimming and rigging
our frigates, boarding and stowing our provisions, tearing
abroad and burning our pinnaces, that the Cimaroons might
have the iton-work.

About a day or two before our departure, our captain
willed PEDRo and three of the ehiefest of the Cimaroons to
go through both his frigates‚ to see what they liked; prom-
ising to give it them, whatsoever it were, so it were not so
necessary as that he could not return into England without
it. And for their wives he would himself seek out some
silks or linen that might gratify them; which while he was
choosing out of his trunks, the scimitar which CAPTAIN
Tm& had given to our Captain, chanced to be taken forth
in PEDRo’s sight: which he seeing grew so much in liking
thereos, that he accounted of nothing else in respect of it,
and preferred it before all that could be given him. Yet
imagining that it was no less esteemed of our Captain‚
durst not himself open his mouth to crave or commend it;
but made one FRANC1s TUCKER to be his mean to break his
mind, promising to give him a fine quoit of gold, which yet
he had in store, if he would but move our Captain for it3
and to our Captain himself, he would give four other great
quoits which he had hidden‚ intending to have reserved
them until another voyage.
