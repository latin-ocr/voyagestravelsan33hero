as they had, viz„ only one gammon of bacon and thirty
¹ pounds of biscuit for eighteen men.’'

Our Captain replied, that “They were better provided
than himself was-who had but one gammon of bacon, and
forty pounds of biscuit for his twenty-four men; and there-
fore he doubted not but they would take such part as he
did, and willingly depend upon GOD's Almighty providence,

With that he hoisted his foresaiI, and set his course for

November), at what time our captain sent in ELL1s ΗΙΧΟΜ,
who had then charge of his pinnace, to search out some
harbour along the coast; who having found out a little one,
some ten or twelve leagues to the east of Santa Marta,
