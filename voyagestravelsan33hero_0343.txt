DISCOVERY OF GUIANA 335

Gome'z de Silva, and by the favour which Ruy Gomes had
with the king he was set out. But he also shot wide of the
mark3 for being departed from Spain with his fleet, he en-
tered by Μαναῆοη or Amazons, where by the nations of the
river and by the Amwons, he was utterly overthrown, and
himself and all his army defeated ; only seven escaped, and of
