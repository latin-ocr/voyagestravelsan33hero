GERMANY 115

not so much noted: before, the Frisians face thern. The
country of F risia is divided into two ; called the greater and
lesser, according to the measure of their strength. Both
nations stretch along the Rhine, quite to the ocean; and
surround vast lakes such as once have borne Roman fleets.
We have moreover even ventured out from thence into the
ocean, and upon its coasts common fame has reported the
pillars of Hercules to be still standing: whether it be that
Hercules ever visited these parts, or that to his renowned
name we are wont to ascribe whatever is grand and glorious
everywhere. Neither did Drusus who made the attempt,
want boldness to pursue it: but the roughness of the ocean
withstood him, nor would suffer discoveries to be made
about itself, no more than about Hercules. Theneet‘orward
the enterprise was dropped: nay‚ more pious and reverential
it seemed, to believe the marvellous seats of the Gods than
to know and to prove them.²²

Hitherto, I have been describing Germany towards the
west. To the northward, it winds away with an immense
compass. And first of all occurs the nation of the Chau-
cians: who though they begin immediately at the confines
of the Frisians, and occupy part of the shore, extend so far
as to border upon all the several people whom I have al-
ready recounted; till at last, by a Circuit, they reach quite
to the boundaries of the Cattans. A region so vast, the
Chaucians do not only possess but fi11; a people of all the
Germans the most noble, such as would rather maintain
their grandeur by justice than violence. They live in repose,
retired from broils abroad‚ void of avidity to possess more,
free from a spirit of domineering over others. They pro·
voke no wars, they ravage no countries, they pursue no
plunder. Of their bravery and power, the chief evidence
arises from hence, that, without wronging or oppressing
others, they are come to be superior to all. Yet they are all
ready to arm, and if an exigency require, armies are pres-
ently raised, powerful and abounding as they are in men
and horses ; and even when they are quiet and their weapons
laid aside, their credit and name continue equally high.

Along the side of the Chaucians and Cattans dwell the
