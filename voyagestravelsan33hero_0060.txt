52 HERODOTUS

are two figures of this man carved upon rocks, one on the
road by which one goes from the land of Ephesos to
Phocaia, and the other on the road from Sardis to Smyrna.
In each place there is a figure of a man cut in the rock‚ of
four cubits and a span in height, holding in his right hand a
spear and in his left a bow and arrows, and the other equip-
ment which he has is similar to this, for it is both Egyptian
and Ethiopian: and from the one shoulder to the other across
the breast runs an inscription carved in sacred Egyptian
- characters, saying thus, “This land with my shoulders Ι

which were six in number, and so to make a bridge over the
burning mass, and that they passing over their bodies-should
thus escape. This, they said, Sesostris did, and two of his
sons were burnt to death in this manner, but the rest got
away safe with their father. Then Sesostris, having re-
turned to Egypt and having taken vengeance on his brother,
employed the multitude which he had brought in of those
whose lands he had subdued‚ as follows t—these were they
who drew the stones which in the reign of this king were
brought to the temple of Hephaistos, being of very great
size; and also these were compelled to dig all the channels
which now are in Egypt3 and thus (having no such purpose)
they caused Egypt, which before was all fit for riding and
driving, to be no longer fit for this from thenceforth: for
from that t'irne foi-ward Egypt, though it is plain land, has
