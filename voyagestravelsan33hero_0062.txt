54 HERODOTUS

to a height of eighteen cubits‚ higher than ever before that
time, and had gone over the fields, a w-ind fell upon it and
the river became agitated by waves: and this king (they say)
moved by presumptuous folly took a spear and cast it into
the midst of the eddies of the stream; and immediately
upon this he had a disease of the eyes and was by it made
blind. For ten years then he was blind, and in the eleventh
year there came to him an oracle from the city of Buto,
saying that the time of his punishment had expired, and
that he should see again if he washed his eyes with the water
of a woman who had accompanied with her own husband
only and had not had knowledge of other men: and first he
made trial of his own wife, and then, as he continued blind,
he went on to try all the women in turn; and when he had

After him, they said, there succeeded to the throne 3 man

Proteus; for whom there is now a sacred enclosure at Mem-
phis, very fair and well ordered, lying on that side of the
temple of Hephaistos which faces the North Wind. Round
about this enclosure dwell Phenicians of Tyre, and this whole
region is called the Camp of the Tyrians. Within the en-
closure of Proteus there is a temple called the temple of the
“ foreign Aphrodite,'’ which temple I conjecture to be one
of Helen the daughter of Tyndareus, not only because I
have heard the tale how Helen dwelt with Proteus, but also
especially because it is called by the name of the “ foreign
Aphrodite,'’ for the other temples of Aphrodite which there
