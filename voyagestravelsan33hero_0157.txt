THIRD VOYAGE 149

but all this time we attempted nothing that we might have
done by the way, neither at [Santiago de] Tolou nor other-
where, because we would not be discovered.

We came to anchor with our two ships in the evening
[13th August], in seven fathom water, between the island
of Charesha [the island of Cartagena, p. 161] and St.
Barnards [San Bernardo].

Our Captain led the three pinnaces about the island, into
