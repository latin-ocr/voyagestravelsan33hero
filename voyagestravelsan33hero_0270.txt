262 DRAKE’S FAMOUS VOYAGE

unlading of this ship and the bestowing thereos and her
men into other ships we departed once again to sea, direct-
ing our course toward the Cape St. Anthony, being the
westermost part of C uba, where we arrived the 27. of April.
But because fresh water could not presently be found, we
weighed anchor and departed, thinking in few days to re-
cover th‘e M atomos, a place to the eastward ot' H avana.

After we had sailed some fourteen days we were brought
to Cape S t. Autlzony again through lack of favourable wind;
but then our searcity was grown such as need make us look
a little better sor water, which we found in sufficient quan-

newly fallen and gathered up by making pits in a plot of
marish ground some three hundred paces from the seaside.

I do wrong if Ι should forget the good example of the
Genera] at this place, who, to encourage others, and to hasten
the getting of fresh water aboard the ships, took no less
pain himself than the meanest3 as also at St. Domingo,

honour; and no less happy do we account him for being
associated with Master Carlile, his Liuetenant-General, by
whose experience, prudent counsel, and gallant person-mance
he achieved so many and happy enterprises of the war, by
whom also he was very greatly assisted in setting down the
needful orders, laws, and course of justice, and the due ad-
ministration of the same upon all occasions.

After three days spent in watering our ships, we departed
now the second time from this Cape of St. Anthony the
13. of May. And proceeding about the Cape of Florida, we
never touched anywhere3 but coasting alongst Florida, and
keeping the shore still in sight, the 28. Of May, early in the
morning, we descried on the shore a place built like a
beacon, which was indeed a scaffold upon four long mas-ts
raised on end for rnen to discover to the seward, being
in the latitude of thirty degrees, or very near thereuntO.
Our pinnaces manned and coming to the shore, we marched
