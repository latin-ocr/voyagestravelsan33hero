216 DRAKE’S FAMOUS VOYAGE

other four 1eagues; but the narrowest place hath a league
over.

The 24. of August we arrived at an island in the Straits,
where we found great store of fowl which could not fly, of
the bigness of geese3 whereof we killed in less than one day
3,ooo, and victualled ourselves throughly therewith. The
6. day of September we entered the South Sea at the cape
or head shore. The 7. day we were driven by a great storm
from the entering into the South Sea, 200 leagues and odd
in longitude, and one degree to the southward of the
Strait; in which height, and so many leagues to the west-
ward, the 15. day of September, fell out the eclipse of the
moon at the hour of six of the clock at night. But neither
did the ecliptical conflict of the moon impair our state, nor her
clearing again amend us a whit; but the accustomed eclipse
of the sea continued in his force, we being darkened more
than the moon sevenfold.⁷

From the bay which we called the Bay of Severing of
friends, we were driven back to the southward of the Straits
in 57 degrees and a tierce; in which height we carne to an
anchor among the islands, having there fresh and very good
water, with herbs of singular virtue. Not far from hence
we entered another bay, where we found people, both men
and women, in their canoes naked, and ranging from one
island to another to seek their meat; who entered traffic
with us for such things as they had. We returning hence
northward again, found the third of October three islands,
in one of which was such plenty of birds as is scant credible
to report. The 8. day of October we lost sight of one of
our consorts,⁸ wherein Master Winter was; who, as then
we supposed, was put by a storrn into the Straits again.
Which at our return home we found to be true, and he not
perished, as some of our company feared. Thus being come
into the height of the Straits again, we ran, supposing
the coast of Chili to lie as the general maps have described
it, namely north-west3 which we found to lie and trend to
the north-east and eastwards. Whereby it appeareth that
this part of Chili hath not been truly hitherto discovered,

⁷ In this storm the Mariqold went down with all hands.
⁸The Elizabeth. VVinter, having lost sight of the Admiral, sailed home.
The Golden Hind was thus left to pursue her voyage alone. ³
