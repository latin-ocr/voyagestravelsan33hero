them by the Oracle about this: and the Nile, when it is in
flood, goes over not only the Delta but also of the land
which is called Libyan and of that which is called Arabian
sometimes as much as two days’ journey on each side, and
at times even more than this or at times less.

As regards the nature of the river, neither from the
priests nor yet from any other man was Ι able to obtain
any knowledge: and I was desirous especially to learn from
them about these matters, namely why the Nile comes down
increasing in volume from the summer solstiee onwards
for a hundred days, and then, when it has reached the num-
ber of these days, turns and goes back, failing in its stream,
so that through the whole winter season it continues to
be low, and until the summer solstice returns. Of none
of these things was Ι able to receive any account from the
Egyptians, when Ι inquired of them what power the Nile
has whereby it is of a nature opposite to that of all other
rivers. And Ι made inquiry, desiring to know both this
which I say and also why, unlike all other rivers, it does
not give rise to any breezes blowing from it. However
some of the Hellenes who desired to gain distinction for
cleverness have given an account of this water in three
different ways: two of these Ι (10 not think it worth while
even to speak of except only to indicate their nature; of
which the one says that the Etesian Winds are the cause
that makes the river rise‚ by preventing the Nile from
flowing out into the sea. But often the Etesian Winds fail
and yet the Nile does the same work as it is wont to d0; and
moreover‚ if these were the cause, all the other rivers also
which flow in a direction opposed to the Etesian Winds
ought to have been affected in the same way as the Nile,
and even more, in as much as they are smaller and present
to thern a feebler flow of streams: but there are many of
these rivers in Syria and many also in Libya, and they are
affected in no such manner as the Nile. The second way
shows more ignorance than that which has been mentioned,
and it is more marvellous to tell; for it says that the river
produces these effects because it flows from the Ocean,
and that the Ocean flows round the whole earth. The
third of the ways is much the most specious‚ but neverthe-
