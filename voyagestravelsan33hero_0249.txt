and double-gilt all over, having eost them a great mass of
money. They complained to have lost in all kinds of goods
above thirty thousand ducats in this place.

The next day the General with his whole fleet went from
up the Isles of Bayon to a very good harbour above Vigo,
where Master Carlile stayed his coming, as well for the more
quiet riding of. his ships, as also for the good commodity of
fresh watering which the place there did afford full well.
In the meantime the governor of Galicia had reared such
forces as he might (his numbers by estimate were some
2000 foot and 300 horse), and marched from Bayona to this
part of the country, which lay in sight of our fleet;
where, making a stand, he sent to parley with our General.
Which was granted by our General, so it might be in boats
upon the water; and for safety of their persons there were
pledges delivered on both sides. Which done, the governor
of Galicia put himself with two others into our vice-Ad*

, miral's skiff, the same having been sent to the shore for him,

and in like sort our General went in his own skiff. Where
by them it was agreed we should furnish ourselves with
fresh water, to be taken by our own people quietly on the
land, and have all other such necessaries, paying for the
same, as the place would afford.

When all our business was ended we departed, and took our
way by the Islands of Canaria, which are esteemed some
300 leagues from this part of Spain ‚· and falling purposely
with Palma, with intention to have taken our pleasure οξ
that place, for the full digesting of many things into order,
and the better furnishing our store with such several good
things as it affordeth very abundantly, we were forced by
the vile sea-gate, which at that present fell out, and by the
naughtiness of the landing-place, being but one, and that
under the favour of many platforms well furnished with
great ordnance, to depart with the receipt of many of their
cannon-shot, some into our ships and some besides, some of
thern being in very deed full cannon high. But the only or
chief mischief was the dangerous sea-surge, which at shore
all alongst plainly threatened the overthrow of as many

pinnaces and boats as for that time should have attempted
any landing at all.
