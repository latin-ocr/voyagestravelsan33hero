192 SIR FRANCIS DRAKE

for that the wind, which had 311 this time been Easterly‚
came up to the Westward, and invited us to return again to
our ship; where, on Sheere Thursday (19th March), we met,
according to appointment, with our Bear, and found that
she had bestowed her time to more profit than we had done.

For she had taken a {rigate in which there were ten rnen
(whom they set ashore) great store of maize, twenty-eight
fat hogs, and two hundred hens. Our Captain discharged
(20th March) this frigate of her lading; and because she
was new, strong, and of a good mould, the next day (21st
March) he tallowed her to make her a Man-of-war: dispos-

whom he had heard long before. And being in great want,
and desirous to be relieved by us: he bare up under our
lee, and in token of amity, shot off his 166 ordnance, which
was not unanswered.

We understood that he was Tmo, a French Captain of
Newhaven [Havre] a Man-of-war as we were, desirous to
