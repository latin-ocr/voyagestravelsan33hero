EGYPT 57

has made mention in the “prowess of Diomede,’' and the
verses run thus:

“ There she had robes many-coloured, the works of women of Sidon,
Those whom her son himself the god-like of form Alexander
Carried from Sidon, what time the broad sea-path he sailed over
Bringing back Helene home, of a noble father begotten.’'

And in the Odyssey also he has made mention of it in these
verses:

“ Such had the daughter of Zeus, such drugs of exquisite cunning,
Good, which to her the wife of Thon, Polydamna‚ had given,
Dwelling in Egypt, the land where the bountiful meadow produces
Drugs more than all lands else, many good being mixed, many evil.'’

And thus too Menelaos says to Telemachos:

“ Still the gods stayed me in Egypt, to come back hither desiring,
Stayed me from voyaging home, since sacrifice due Ι performed
not.’'

In these lines he makes it clear that he knew of the wander-
ing of Alexander to Egypt, for Syria borders upon Egypt and
the Phenicians, of whom is Sidon, dwell in Syria. By these
lines and by this passage it is also most clearly shown that
the “ Cyprian Epic '’ was not written by Homer but by some
other man: for in this it is said that on the third day after
leaving Sparta Alexander came to Ilion bringing with him
Helen, having had a “gently—blowing wind and a smooth
sea,'' whereas in the Iliad it says that he wandered from his
course when he brought her.

Let us now leave Homer and the “Cyprian Epic ”5 but
this I will say, namely that I asked the priests whether it
is but an idle tale which the Hellenes tell of that which they
say happened about Ilion; and they answered me thus, saying
that they had their knowledge by inquiries from Menelaos
himself. After the rape of Helen there carne indeed, they
said, to the Teucrian land a large army of Hellenes to help
Menelaos; and when the army had come out of the ships to
land and had pitched its camp there, they sent messengers to
Ilion, with whom went also Menelaos himse1f; and when
these entered within the wall they demanded back Helen
and the wealth which Alexander had stolen from Menelaos
