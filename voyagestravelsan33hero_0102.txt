INTRODUCTORY NOTE

THE dates of the birth and death of Tacitus are uncertain, but
it is probable that he was born about 54 A. D. and died after 117.
He was a contemporary and friend of the younger Pliny, who
addressed to him some of his most famous epistles, to be found
in another volume of the Harvard C lassics. Tacitus was appar-
ently of the equestrian class, was an advocate by traininy, and
had a reputation as an orator, thouyh none of his speeches has.
survived. He held a number of important public offices, and
married the dauyhter of Ay-ricola, the conqueror of Britain, whose
life he wrote.

The two chief works of Tacitus, the “Animis” and the “His-
tories,” covered the history of Rome from the death of Augustus
to A. D. 96,· but the greater part os the “Histories” is lost, and
the frayment that remains deals only with the year 69 and part
of 70. In the “Animis'’ there are several yaps, but what survives
describes a large part of the reiyns of Tiberius, Claudius, and
Nero. His minor works, besides the life of Ayricola, already
mentioned, are a “Dialoyue on Orators'’ and the account of Ger-
many, its situation, its inhabitants, their character and customs,
which is here printed.

Tacitus stands in the front rank of the historians of antiquity
for the accuracy of his learniny, the fairness of his judyments,
the richness, concentration, and precision of his style. His yreat
successor, Gibbon, called him a “philosophical historian, whose
writinys will instruct the last yenerations of mankind”; and Mon-
taiyne knew no author “who, in a work of history, has taken so
broad a view of human events or yiven a more just analysis of
particular characters.”

The “Germanff’ is a document of the yreatest interest and im-
portance, since it yives us by far the most detailed account of
the state of culture ainony the tribes that are the ancestors of the
modern Teutonic nations,at the time when they first came into
contact with the civilization of the Mediterranean.
