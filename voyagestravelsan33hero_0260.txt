252 DRAKE’S FAMOUS VOYAGE

words in Latin, NON SUFFICIT omns, which is as much to say
as, The world sufficeth not. Whereof the meaning was re-
quired to be known of some of those of the better sort that
carne in commission to treat upon the ransom of the town ;
who would shake their heads and turn aside their
countenance, in some smiling sort, without answering any-
thing, as greatly ashamed thereos. For by some of our
company it was told thern, that if the Queen of Enyland
would resolutely prosecute the wars against the King of
Spain, he should be forced to lay aside that proud and un-
reasonable reaching vein of his; for he should find more
than enough to do to keep that which he had already, as
by the present example of their lost town they might for

Now to the satisfying of some men, who marvel greatly

And thereby they are fain in this island to use copper money,

strong wine, sweet oil‚ vinegar, olives, and other such-like
provisions, as excellent wheat-meal packed up in wine-pipes
and other cask, and other commodities likewise, as woollen
