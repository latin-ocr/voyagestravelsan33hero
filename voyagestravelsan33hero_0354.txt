346 SIR WALTER RALEIGH

there was one as well favoured and as well shaped as ever
I saw any in England; and afterwards Ι saw many of
thern, which but for their tawny colour may be compared
to any in Europe. They also trade in those rivers for
bread of cassavi, of which they buy an hundred pound
weight for a knife, and sell it at Margarita for ten pesos.
They also recover great store of cotton, Brazil wood, and
those beds which they call hamacas or Brazil beds, wherein
in hot countries all the Spaniards use to lie commonly,
and in no other, neither did we ourselves while we were
there. By means of which trades, for ransom of divers oi

After I had thus learned of his proceedings past and

that it was the end of my journey, and the cause of my
coming to Trinidad, as it was indeed, and for that purpose
I sent Jacob Whiddon the year before to get intelligence:
with whom Berreo himself had speech at that time, and re-
membered how inquisitive Jacob Whiddon was of his pro-
eeedings‚ and of the country of Gaiana. Berreo was stricken
into a great melancholy and sadness, and used all the argu-
ments he could to dissuade me; and also assured the gentle-

should suffer many miseries if they proceeded. And first
