THIRD VOYAGE 197

confess where his frigate and ships were. Therefore in this
distress and perplexity, the company misdoubting that all
means of return to their country were cut off, and that their
treasure then served them to small purpose; our Captain
comforted and encouraged us all, saying‚ “ We should ven-
ture no farther than he did. It was no time now to fear:
but rather to haste[n] to prevent that which was feared!
If the enemy have prevailed against our pinnaces‚ which
GOD forbid! yet they must have time to search thern, time
to examine the mariners, time to execute their resolution
after it is determined. Before all these times be taken, we
may get to our ships, if ye will! though not possibly by land,
because of the hills, thickets, and rivers, yet by water. Let
us, therefore, make a raft with the trees that are here in
readiness, as offering themselves, being brought down the
river, happily this last storm, and put ourselves to sea! I
will be one, who will be the other? '’

ιῙΟΗΝ SMITH offered himself, and two Frenchmen that
could swim very well, desired they might accompany our
Captain, as did the Cimaroons likewise (who had been very
earnest with our Captain to have marched by land, though
it were sixteen days’ journey, and in case the ship had been
surprised, to have abode always with them), especially
PEDRo, who yet was fain to be left behind, because he could
not row.

The raft was fitted and fast bound; a sail of a biscuit
sack prepared; an oar was shaped out of a young tree to
serve instead of a rudder, to direct their course before the
wind. ’

At his departure he comforted the company, by promising,
that ‘⁴ If it pleased GOD, he should put his foot in safety
aboard his frigate‚ he would, GOD willing, by one means or
other get them all aboard, in despite of all the Spaniards in
the Indies ἔ ”

In this manner pulling off to the sea, he sailed some three
leagues, sitting up to the waist continually in water, and at
every surge of the wave to the arm-pits, for the space of six
hours, upon this raft: what with the parching of the sun and
what with the beating of the salt water, they had all of them
their skins much fretted away.
