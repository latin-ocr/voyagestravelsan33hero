80 HERODOTUS

do that which they do. I say then that Melampus being a
man of ability contrived for himself an art of divination,
and having learnt from Egypt he taught the Hellenes many
things, and among them those that concern Dionysos, mak-
ing changes in some few points of them: for I shall not say
that that which is done in worship of the god in Egypt came
accidentally to be the same with that which is done among
the Hellenes, for then these rites would have been in
character with the Hellenic worship and not lately brought
in; nor certainly shall Ι say that the Egyptians took from the
Hellenes either this or any other customary observance:
but Ι think it most probable that Melampus learnt the
matters concerning Dionysos from Cadmos the Tyrian and
from those who came with him from Phenicia to the land
which we now call Boeotia.

Moreover the naming of almost all the gods has come
to Hellas from Egypt: for that it has come from the Bar·

with that which Ι have said before), and also of Hera and
Hestia and Themis and the Charites and Nereids, the
Egyptians have had the names of all the other gods in their
country for all time. What Ι say here is that which the
Egyptians say themselves: but as for the gods whose names
they profess that they do not know, these I think received
their naming from the Pelasgians‚ except Poseidon ; but
about this god the Hellenes learnt from the Libyans, for
no people except the Libyans have had the name of
Poseidon from the first and have paid honour to this god
always Nor, it may be added, have the Egyptians any
custom of worshipping heroes. These observances then,
and others besides these which Ι shall mention, the Hellenes
have adopted from the Egyptians; but to make, as they do,
the images of Hermes with the phallos they have learnt
not from the Egyptians but from the Pelasgians‚ the cus-
tom having been received by the Athenians first of all the
Hellenes and from these by the rest ; for just at the time
when the Athenians were beginning to rank among the
Hellenes, the Pelasgians became dwellers with them in theit-
