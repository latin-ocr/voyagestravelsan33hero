286 GILBERT'S VOYAGE

ful in such mischief, as they took their cockboat to go aboard
their own ship‚ it was overwhelmed in the sea, and certain
of these men there drowned3 the rest were preserved even
by those silly souls whom they had before spoiled‚ who saved
and delivered them aboard the Swallow. What became
