day, and not some only do this but all: they wear garments
of linen always newly washed, and this they make a special
point of practice: they circumcise themselves for the sake
of cleanliness, preferring to be clean rather than comely.
The priests shave themselves all over their body every other

upright and when it is lying on its back, drawing out its
tongue moreover, to see if it is clean in respect of the
appointed signs, which I shall tell of in another part of
the history: he looks also at the hairs of the tail to see if
it has them growing in the natural manner; and if
it be clean in respect of all these things, he marks it with
a piece of papyrus, rolling this round the horns, and then
when he has plastered sealing-earth over it he sets upon
it the seal of his signet-ring, and after that they take the
