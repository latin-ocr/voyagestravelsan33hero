342 SIR WALTER RALEIGH

Now Berreo began to grow into despair, and looked for
no other success than his predecessor in this enterprise3
until such time as he arrived at the province of Emeria
towards the east sea and mouth of the river, where he found
a nation of people very favourable, and the country full of
all manner of victual. The king of this landi is called
Campana, a man very wise, subtle, and of great experiente,
being little less than an hundred years old. In his youth
he was sent by his father into the island of Trinidad, by
reason of civil war among themselves, and was bred at a
village in that island, called Parico. At that place in his
youth he had seen many Christians, both Freneh and
Spanish, and went divers times with the Indians of Trinidad
to Margarita and Cumand, in the West Indies, for both
those places have ever been relieved with victual from
Trinidad: by reason whereof he grew of more under-
standing, and noted the differenee of the nations, com<
paring the strength and arms of his country with those
of the Christians, and ever after temporised so as whoso·
ever else did amiss, or was wasted by contention‚ Campana
kept himself and his country in quiet and plenty. He
also held peace with the Coribs or cannibals‚ his neigh-
bourS, and had free trade with all nations, whosoever else
had war.

Berreo sojourned and rested his weak troop in the town
of Campana six weekS, and from him learned the way and
passage to Gaiana, and the riches and magnificence thereos.
But being then utterly unable to proceed, he determined to
try his fortune another year, when he had renewed his pro-
visions, and regathered more soree, which he hoped for as
well out of Spain as from Nuevo Reyno, where he had left
his son Don Antonio Ximenes to second him upon the first
notice given of his entrance; and so for the present em-
barked himself in canoas, and by the branches of Orenoque
arrived at Trinidczd, having from Campana sufficient pilots
to conduct him. From Trinidad he coasted Paria, and so
recovered Margarita; and having made relation to Don
suan Sarmiewzto, the Governor, of his proceeding‚ and per-
suaded him of the riches of Gaiana, he obtained from thence
fifty soldiers, promising presently to return to Campana, and
