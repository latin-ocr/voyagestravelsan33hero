GERMANY 117

loss of the great King Pacorus bereft of his life? But by
the Germans the Roman People have been bereft of five
armies, all commanded by Consuls3 by the Germans, the
commanders of these armies, Carbo, and Cassius, and
Scaurus Aurelius, and Servilius Caepio, as also Marcus Man-
lius, were all routed or taken: by the Germans even the
Emperor Augustus was bereft of Varus and three legions.
Nor without difficulty and loss of men were they defeated
by Caius Marius in Italy, or by the deified Julius in Gaul,

in a manner stern and staring; and often tie it upon the
top of their head only. That of their Princes, is more ac-
curately disposed, and so far they study to appear agreeable
and come1y; but without any culpable intention. For by it,
they mean not to make love or to incite it: they thus dress
when proceeding to war, and deck their heads so as to add
