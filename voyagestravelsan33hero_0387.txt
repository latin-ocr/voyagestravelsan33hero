DISCOVERY OF GUIANA 379

counsel to have attempted it at that time, although the desire
for gold will answer many objections. But it would have
been, in mine opinion, an utter overthrow to the enterprise,
if the same should be hereafter by her Majesty attempted.
For then, whereas now they have heard we were enemies to
the Spaniards and were sent by her Majesty to relieve them,
they would as good cheap have joined with the Spaniards ³0¹⁴·
our return, as to have yielded unto us, when they had proved
that we carne both for one errand, and that both sought but
to sack and spoil them. But as yet our desire of gold, or
our purpose of invasion, is not known to them of the empire.
And it is likely that if her Majesty undertake the enterprise
they will rather submit themselves to her obedience than to
the Spaniards, of whose cruelty both themselves and the bor-
derers have already tasted. And therefore, till Ι had known
her Majesty's pleasure‚ I would rather have lost the sack
of one or two towns, although they might have been very
profitable, than to have defaced or endangered the future
hope of so many millions, and the great good and rich trade
which England may be possessed of thereby. Ι am assured
now that they will all die, even to the last man, against the
Spaniards in hope of our succour and return. Whereas,
otherwise, if Ι had either laid hands on the borderers or
ransomed the lords, as Berreo did, or invaded the subjects
of Inga, Ι know all had been lost for hereat‘ter.

After that I had resolved Topiawari, lord of Aromaia, that
Ι could not at this time leave with him the companies he de-
sired, and that I was contented to forbear the enterprise
against the Epuremei till the next year, he freely gave me
his only son to take with rne into England; and hoped that
though he himself had but a short time to live, yet that by
our means his son should be established after his death.
And I left with him one Francis Sparrow, a servant of Cap-
tain Gifford, who was desirous to tarry, and could describe
a country with his pen, and a boy of mine called Hugh
Goodwin, to learn the language. Ι after asked the manner
how the Epuremei wrought those plates of gold, and how
they could melt it out of the stone. He told me that the
most of the gold which they made in plates and images was
not severed from the stone, but that on the lake of Μαηοα,
