178 SIR FRANCIS DRAKE

descended3 and after our repast, continued our ordinary
march through woods, yet two days more as before: without
any great variety. But then (13th February) we carne to
march in a champion country, where the grass groweth, not
only in great lengths as the knot grass groweth in many
places, but to such height, that the inhabitants are fain to
burn it thrice in the year, that it may be able to seed the
cattle, of which they have thousands.

For it is a kind of grass with'a stalk, as big as a great
wheaten reed, which hath a blade issuing from the top of
it, on which though the cattle seed, yet it groweth every day
higher, until the top be too high for an ox to reach. Then
the inhabitants are wont to put fire to it, for the space of
five or six miles together; which notwithstanding after it is
thus burnt‚ within three days, springeth up fresh like green
corn. Such is the great fruitfulness of the soil: by reason
of the evenness of the day and night, and the rich dews
which fall every morning.

In these three last days’ march in the champion, as we
past over the hius, we might see Panama five or six times a
day; ancl the last day (14th February) we saw the ships
riding in the road.

But after that we were come within a day's journey of
Panama, our Captain (understanding by the Cimaroons that
the Dames of Panama are wont to send forth hunters and
fowlers for taking οἱ sundry dainty fowl, which the land
yieldeth3 by whom if we marched not very heedfully, we
might be descried) caused all his company to march out of
all ordinary way, and that with as great heed, silence, and
secrecy, as possibly they might, to the grove (which was
agreed on four days before) lying within a league of
Panama, where we might lie safely undiscovered near the
highway, that leadeth from thence to Nombre de Dios.

Thence we sent a chosen Cimaroon, one that had served a
master in Panama before time, in such apparel as the
Negroes of Panama do use to wear, to be our espial, to go
into the town, to learn the certain night, and time of the
night, when the carriers laded the Treasure from the King’s
Treasure House to Nombre de Dios For they are wont to
take their journey from Panama to Venta CruZ, which is six
