272 GILBERT’S VOYAGE

more, and had long since attained a sure possession and
settled government of many provinces in those northerly
parts of America, if their many attempts into those foreign
and remote lands had not been impeached by their garboils
at home.

The first discovery of these coasts, never heard of before,
was well begun by J olm Cabot the father and Sebastian his
son, an Englishman born, who were the first finders out of
all that great tract of land stretching from the Cape of
Florida unto those islands which we now call the N ewfound-
land; all which they brought and annexed unto the crown
of England. Since when, if with like diligence the search
of inland countries had been followed, as the discovery upon
the coast and outparts thereos was performed by those two
men, no doubt her Majesty's territories and revenue had
been mightily enlarged and advanced by this day; and, which
is more, the seed of Christian religion had been sowed
amongst those pagans‚ which by this time might have
brought forth a most plentiful harvest and copious congre-
gation of Christians; which must be the chief intent of such
as shall make any attempt that way; or else whatsoever is
builded upon other foundation shall never obtain happy suc-
cess nor continuance.

And although we cannot precisely judge (which only be-
longeth to God) what have been the humours of men stirred
up to great attempts of discovering and planting in those
remote countries, yet the events do shew that either God's
cause hath not been chiefly preferred by them, or else God
hath not permitted so abundant grace as the light of His
word and knowledge of Him to be yet revealed unto those
infidels before the appointed time. But most assuredly, the
only cause of religion hitherto hath kept back, and will also
bring forward at the time assigned by God, an effectual and
complete discovery and possession by Christians both of
those ample countries and the riches within them hitherto .
concealed; whereof, notwithstanding, God in His wisdom
hath permitted to be revealed from time to tim-e a certain
obscure and misty knowledge, by little and little to allure the
minds of men that way, which else will be dull enough in the
zeal of His cause, and thereby to prepare us unto a readiness
