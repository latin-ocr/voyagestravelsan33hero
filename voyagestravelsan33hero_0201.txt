THIRD VOYAGE 193

heing upon the coast, about this five weeks. Our Captain
sent one aboard him with some relies for the present, willing
him to follow us to the next port, where he should have both
water and victuals.

At our coming to anchor, he sent our Captain a case of
pistols, and a fair gilt scimitar (which had been the late
King's of France [HENRY II.], whom Monsieur MONTGOMERY
hurt in the eye, and was given him by Monsieur STROZZE).
Our Captain requited him with a chain ot* gold, and a tablet
which he wore.

This Captain reported unto us the first news of the
Massacre of Paris, at the King of NAVARRE's marriage on
Saint Bartholomew’s Day last, [24 August, 1572]; of the

be hurt by their portions, being no greater than ours: and
yet gratify thern in their earnest suit, and serve our own
purpose, which without more help we could very hardly
have achieved. Indeed, he had 70 men, and we now but 313
his ship was above 80 tons, and our frigate not 20, or pinnace
nothing near 10 tons. Yet our Captain thought this pro-
portionable, in consideration that not numbers of men, but
quality of their judgements and knowledge, were to be the
principal actors herein: and the French ship could do no
service, nor stand in any stead to this enterprise which we
intended, and had agreed upon before, both touching the
