2³6 DRAKE'S FAMOUS VOYAGE

Walter Biggs‚ who commanded a company of musketeers under
Carlile. Biggs was one of the five hundred and odd men who
succumbed to the sever. He died shortly after the fleet sailed
from Carthagena ; and the narrative was completed by some corn-
rade. The story of this expedition, which had inflicted such
damaging blows on the Spaniards in America, was eminently cal-
culated to inspire courage among those who were resisting them
in Europe. Cates, one of Carlile's lieutenants, obtained the manu-
script and prepared it for the press, accompanied by illustrative
maps and plans. The publication was delayed by the Spanish
Armada; but a copy found its way to Holland, where it was
translated into Latin. and appeared at Leyden, in a slightly
¹ abridged form, in 1588. The original English narrative duly ap-
peared in London in the next year. The document called the
‘ Resolution of the Land-Captains' was inserted by Hakluyt when
he reprinted the narrative in 1600.
