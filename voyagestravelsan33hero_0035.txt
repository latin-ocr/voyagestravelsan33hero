EGYPT 2⁷

my judgment compels me to think; so that the Egyptians
would have learnt the names of these gods even more than
that of Heracles. In fact however Heracles is a very
ancient Egyptian god; and (as they say themselves) it is
seventeen thousand years to the beginning of the reign
of Amasis from the time when the twelve gods, of whom
they count that Heracles is one, were begotten of the eight
gods. I moreover‚ desiring to know something certain of
these matters so far as might be, made a voyage also to
Tyre of Phenicia, hearing that in that place there was a

' holy temple of Heracles; and I saw that it was richly fur-

nished with many votive offerings besides, and especially
there were in it two pillars‚ the one of pure gold and the
other of an emerald stone of such size as to shine by night:
and having come to speech with the priests of the god, I
asked them how long a time it was since their temple had
been set up: and these also I found to be at variance with
the Hellenes, for they said that at the same time when Tyre
was founded, the temple of the god also had been set up,
and that it was a period of two thousand three hundred
years since their people began to dwell at Tyre. Ι saw also
at Tyre another temple of Heracles‚ with the surname
Thasiam and I came to Thasos also and there I found
a temple of Heracles set up by the Phenicians, who had
sailed out to seek for Europa and had colonised Thasos;
and these things happened full five generations of men
before Heracles the son of Amphitryon was born in Hellas.
So then my inquiries show clearly that Heracles is an
ancient god, and those of the Hellenes seem to me to act
most rightly who have two temples ot' Heracles set up, and
who sacrifice to the one as an immortal god and with the
title Olympian, and make offerings of the dead to the other
as a hero. Moreover, besides many other stories which the
Hellenes tell without due consideration, this tale is especially
foolish which they tell about Heracles, namely that when
he came to Egypt, the Egyptians put on him wreaths and
led him forth in procession to sacrifice him to Zeus; ancl
he for some time kept quiet, but when they were beginning
the sacrifice of him at the altar, he betook himself to
prowess and slew them all. I for my 'part am of opinion
