men were wounded with our arrows, whether they were
poisoned or not? and how their wounds might best be cured?
lastly, What victuale we wanted, or other necessaries? of
which the Governor promised by him to supply and furnish
us, as largely as he durst.''

Our Captain, although he thought this soldier but a spy:
yet used him very courteously, and answered him to his
Governor’s demands: that “He was the same DRAKE whom
they meant! It was never his manner to poison his arrows!

after dinner, he was in such sort dismissed, to make report
of that he had seen, that he protested‚ “he was never so
much honoured of any in his life.”

After his departure, the Negro {ormentioned being ex-
