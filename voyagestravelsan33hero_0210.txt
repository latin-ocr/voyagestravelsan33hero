202 SIR FRANCIS DRAKE

Our Captain being accordingly moved by Famem TUCKER,
could have been content to have made no such exchange;
but yet desirous to content him, that had deserved so well,
he gave it him with many good words: who received it with
no little joy, affirming that if he should give his wife and
children which he loved dearly in lieu of it, he could not
sufficient recompense it (for he would present his king with
it, who he knew would make him a great man, even for this
very gift’s sake); yet in gratuity and stead of other re-
quital of this jewel, he desired our Captain to accept these
four pieces of gold, as a token of his thankfulness to him,
and a pawn of his faithfulness during life.

Our Captain received it in most kind sort, but took it not
to his own benefit, but caused it to be cast into the whole
Adventure, saying, “If he had not been set forth to that
place, he had not attained such a commodity, and therefore
it was just that they which bare part with him of his burden
in setting him to sea, should enjoy the proportion of his
benefit whatsoever at his return.'’

Thus with good love and liking we took our leave of that
people‚ setting over to the islands of [ ? ]‚ whence
the next day after, we set sail towards Cape St. Antoni03 by
which we past with a large wind: but presently being to
stand for the Havana, we were fain to ply to the windward*
some three or four days; in which plying we fortuned to
take a small bark‚ in which were two or three hundred hides,
and one most necessary thing, which stood us in great stead,
viz„ a pump! which we set in our frigate. Their bark
because it was nothing fit for our service, our Captain gave
them to carry them horne.

And so returning to Cape St. Antonio, and landing there,
we refreshed ourselves, and beside great store of turtle
eggs, found by day in the [sand], we took 250 turtles by
night. We powdered [salted] and dried some of thern,
which did us good service. The rest continued but a small
time.

There were, at this time, belonging to Cartagena, Nombre
de Dios, Rio Grande, Santa Marta, Rio de la Hacha, Venta
Cruz, Veragua‚ Nicaragua, the Honduras, Jamaica &c.‚
above 200 frigates3 some of a 120 tons, others but of 10 01:
