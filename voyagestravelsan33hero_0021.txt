EGYPT 13

dary properly speaking between Asia and Libya except the
borders of Egypt. If however we shall adopt the opinion
which is commonly held by the Hellenes, we shall suppose
that the whole of Egypt, beginning from the Cataract and
the city of Elephantine, is divided into two parts and that
it thus partakes of both the nameS, since one side will thus
belong to Libya and the other to Asia; for the Nile from
the Cataraet onwards flows to the sea cutting Egypt through
in the midst; and as far as the city of Kercasoros the Nile
flows in one single stream, but from this city onwards it is
parted into three ways; and one, which is called the Pelusian
mouth, turns towards the East; the second of the ways goes
towards the West, and this is called the Canobic n1outh; but
that one of the ways which is straight runs thus,—when
the river in its course downwards comes to the point of the
Delta, then it cuts the Delta through the midst and so issues
out to the sea. In this we have a portion of the water of the
river which is not the smallest nor the least famous, and it is
called the Sebennytic mouth. There are also two other mouths
which part off from the Sebennytic and go to the sea, and
these are called, one the Saitic,the other the Mendesian mouth.
The Bolbitinitic‚ and Bucolic mouths, on the other hand, are
not natural but made by digging. Moreover also the answer
given by the Oracle of Ammon bears witness in support of.

city of Marea and of Apis, dwelling in the parts of Egypt
which border on Libya, being of opinion themselves that
they were Libyans and not Egyptians, and also being bur-
dened by the rules of religious service, because they desired
not to be debarred from the use of cows’ flesh, sent to
Ammon saying that they had nought in common with the
Egyptians, for they dwelt outside the Delta and agreed with
them in nothing; and they said they desired that it might be
lawful for them to eat everything without distinction. The
god however did not permit them to do so, but said that that
land was Egypt which the Nile came over and watered, and
that those were Egyptians who dwelling below the city of
Elephantine drank of that river. Thus was it answered to
