246 DRAKE’S FAMOUS VOYAGE

of Captain Barton, and the company of Captain Biggs, under
the leading of captain Sampson, to seek out such munition
as was hidden in the ground, at the town of Praya, or Playa,
having been promised to be shewed it by a prisoner which
was taken the day before.

The captains aforesaid coming to the Playa, landed their
men; and having placed the troop in their best strength,
Captain Sampson took the prisoner, and willed him to show

the town, or island, ever came at us; which we expected
they should have done, to entreat us to leave them some part
of their needful provisions, or at the least to spare the ruining
of their town at our going away. The cause of this their
unreasonable distrust‚ as I do take it, was the fresh remem-
brance of the great wrongs that they had done to old Master
Wilziam Hawkins, of Plymouth, in the voyage he made four
or five years before, whenas they did both break their prom-
ise, and murdered many of his men; whereof Ι judge you
have understood, and therefore it is needless to be repeated.
But since they came not at ηε, we left written in sundry
