in the middle country; and all the rest, InstaevoneS. Some,
borrowing a wax-rant from the darkness of antiquity, main-
tain that the God had more sons, that thence came more
denominations of people‚ the Marsians‚ Gambrians,
Suevians, and Vandafians, and that these are the names
truly genuine and original. For the rest, they affirm Ger-
many to be a recent word, Iately bestowed: for that those
who first passed the Rhine and expulsed the Gauls‚ and are
now named Tungrians, were then called Germans: and
thus by degrees the name of a tribe prevailed, not that of
the nation; so that by an appellation at first occasioned by
terror zand conquest, they afterwards chose to be dis-
tinguished, and assuming a name lately invented were
universally called Germans.

They have a tradition that Hercules also had been in
their country, and him above all other heroes they extol
in their songs when they advance to battle. Amongst them
too are found that kind of verses by the recital of which
(by them called Barding) they inspire bravery; nay, by
such chanting itself they divine the success of the approach-
ing fight. For, according to the different din of the battle,
they urge furiously, or shrink timorously. Nor does what
they utter‚ so much seem to be singing as the voice and
exertion of valour. They chiefly study a tone fierce and
harsh, with a broken and unequal murmur, and therefore
apply their shields to their mouths, whence the voice may
by rebounding swell with greater fulness and force. Be-
sides there are some of opinion, that Ulysses, whilst he
wandered about in his long and fabulous voyages, was
carried into this ocean and entered Germany, and that by
him Asciburgium was founded and named, a city at this
day standing and inhabited upon the bank of the Rhine:
nay, that in the same place was formerly found an altar
dedicated to Ulysses‚ with the name of his father Laertes
added to his own, and that upon the confines of Germany
and Rhoetia are still extant certain monuments and tombs
inscribed with Greek characters. Traditions these which
I mean not either to confirm with arguments of my own
or to refute. Let every one believe or deny the same ac-
cording to his own bent.
