EGYPT 49

that on the one hand he banked off the site of Memphis
from the river: for the whole stream of the river used to
flow along by the sandy mountain-range on the side of Libya,
but Min formed by embankments that bend of the river
which lies to the South about a hundred furlongs above
Memphis, and thus he dried up the old stream and conducted
the river so that it flowed in the middle between the
mountains: and even now this bend of the Nile is by the
Persians kept under very careful watch, that it may flow
in the channel to which it is confined, and the bank is repaired
every year; for if the river should break through and over-
flow in this direction, Memphis would be in danger of being
overwhelmed by flood. When this Min, who first became
king, had made into dry land the part which was dammed
off, on the one hand, I say, he founded in it that city which
is now called Memphis; for Memphis too is in the narrow
part of Egypt; and outside the city he dug round it on the
North and West a lake communicating with the river, for the
side towards the East is barred by the Nile itself. Then
secondly he established in the city the temple of Hephaistos

and of Egyptian race: and the name of the woman who
reigned was the same as that of the Babylonian queen,
namely NitocriS. Of her they said that desiring to take
vengeance for her brother, whom the Egyptians had slain
when he was their king and then, after having slain him,
had given his kingdom to her‚—desiring, I say, to take
vengeance for him, she destroyed by craft many of the
Egyptians. For she caused to be constructed a very large
chamber under ground, and making as though she would
handsel it but in her mind devising other things, she invited
those of the Egyptians whom she knew to have had most part
in the murder, and gave a great banquet. Then while they
were feasting, she let in the river upon them by a secret con-
duit of large size. Of her they told no more than this, except
that, when this had been accomplished, she threw herself
