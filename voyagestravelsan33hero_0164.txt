156 SIR FRANCIS DRAKE

those houses: that the frigates (these are ordinarily thirty,
or upwards, which usually transport the merchandise, sent
out of Spain to Cartagena from thence to these houses, and
so in great canoes up hence into Nuevo Reyno, for which
the river running many hundred of leagues within the land
serveth very fitly: and return in exchange, the gold and
treasure, silver‚ victuals, and commodities, which that king-

September] five or six frigates, which were laden from
Tolou‚ with live hogs, hens, and maize which we call
Guinea wheat. Of these, having gotten what intelligence
they could give, of their preparations for us, and divers
opinions of us, we dismissed all the men; only staying two
frigates with us, because they were so well stored with good
victuals.
