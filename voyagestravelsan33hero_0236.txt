228 DRAKE’S FAMOUS VOYAGE

that present. In the meantime, our General’s messenger,
being come to the Court, was met by certain noble person-
ages with great solemnity‚ and brought to the king, at whose
hands he was most friendly and graciously entertained.

The king, purposing to come to our ship, sent before four
great and large canoas, in every one whereof were certain
of his greatest states¹⁷ that were about him, attired in white
lawn of eloth of Calicut, having over their heads, from the
one end of the canoa to the other, a covering of thin per-

being orderly builded lower than another, in every of which
galleries were the number of fourscore rowers. These
canoas were furnished with warlike munition, every man
for the most part having his sword and target, with his
dagger, beside other weapons, as lances, calivers‚ dans, bows
and arrows; also every canoa had a small cast base mounted
at the least one full yard upon a stock set upright. Thus
coming near our ship, in order, they rowed about us one

solemnity ; the great personages beginning with great gravity
and fatherly countenances‚ signifying that the king had
sent them to conduct our ship into a better road. Soon after
the king himself repaired, accompanied with six grave and
ancient persons, who did their obeisance with marvellous
humility. The king was a man of tall stature, and seemed
to be much delighted with the sound of our music; to
whom, as also to his nobility, our General gave presents,
wherewith they were passing well contented.

At length the king craved leave of our General to depart,
promising the next day to come aboard, and in the meantime
