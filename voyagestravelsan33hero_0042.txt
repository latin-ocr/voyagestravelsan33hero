34 HERODOTUS

and some of the women continue to do as I have said, others
cry aloud and jeer at the women in that city, some dance,
and some stand up and pull up their garments. This they
do by every city along the river—bank; and when they come
to Bubastis they hold festival celebrating great sacrifices,
and more wine of grapes is consumed upon that festival
than during the whole of the rest of the year. To this place
, (so say the natives) they come together year by year even
’ to the number of severity myriads of men and women, be-

the festival in honour of Isis at the city of Busiris has been
told by me before: for, as I said, they beat themselves in
mourning after the sacrifice, all of them both men and
women, very many myriads of people; but for whom they

and thus not in Sais alone are they lighted, but over all
Egypt: and as to the reason why light and honour are
allotted to this night, about this there is a sacred story told.
To Heliopolis and Buto they go year by year and do sacrifice·
only: but at Papremis they do sacrifice and worship as else-
where, and besides that, when the sun begins to go down,
while some few of the priests are occupied with the image
of the god, the greater number of them stand in the entrance
of the temple with wooden clubs, and other persons to the
number of more than a thousand men with purpose to per-
