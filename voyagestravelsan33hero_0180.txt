most islands of the Cativaas‚ to descry the truth of the re-
port: by reason it must needs be, that if the Fleet werein
Nombre de Dios, all frigates of the country would repair
thitherward with victuals.

The Lion‚ within a few days descried that she was sent
for, espying a frigate, which she presently boarded and
took, laden with maize, hens, and pompions from Tolou;
who assured us of the whole truth of the arrival of the
Fleet: in this frigate were taken one woman and twelve

men, and a few whole men were left aboard with ELLIS
H1XOM to keep the ship, ancl attend the siek, and guard
the prisoners.

At his departure our Captain gave this Master straight
