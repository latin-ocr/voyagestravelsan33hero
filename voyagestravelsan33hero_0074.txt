about a hundred feet high. And Chephren tney said reigned
fifty and six years. Here then they reckon one hundred and
2 six years, during which they say that there was nothing but
evil for the Egyptians, and the temples were kept closed and
not opened during all that time. These kings the Egyptians
by reason of their hatrcd οἱ thern are not very willing to
name; nay, they even call the pyramids after the name of
Philitis the shepherd, who at that time pastured flocks in
those regions. After him, they said, Mykerinos became
king over Egypt, who was the son of Cheops; and to him
his father’s deeds were displeasing, and he both opened the
temples and gave liberty to the people‚ who were ground

the city of Sais, placed within the royal palace in a chamber
which was greatly adorned; and they offer incense of all
kinds before it every day, and each night a lamp burns be-
side it all through the night. Near this cow in another
chamber stand images of the concubines of Mykerinos, as
the priests at Sais told me; for there are in fact colossal
wooden statues, in number about twenty, made with naked
bodies; but who they are Ι am not able to say, except only
that which is reported. Some however tell about this cow
and the colossal statues the following tale, namely that·
