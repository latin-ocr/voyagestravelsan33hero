294 GILBERT'S VOYAGE

obtain an habitation in those remote lands, in which nature
very prodigally doth minister unto men's endeavours, and
for art to work upon. For besides these already recounted
and infinite more, the mountains generally make shew of
mineral substance; iron very common, lead, and somewhere
copper. Ι will not aver ot* richer metals; albeit by the cir-
cumstances following, more than hope may be conceived
thereos.

For amongst other charges given to enquire out the
singularities of this country, the General was most curious
in the search of metals‚ commanding the mineral-man and
refiner especially to be diligent. The same was a Sax0n⁸
born, honest, and religious, named Daniel. Who after search
brought at first some sort of ore, seeming rather to be iron
than other metal. The next time he found ore, which with
no small show of contentment he delivered unto the General,
using protestation that if silver were the thing which might
satisfy the General and his followers, there it was, advising
him to seek no further; the peril whereof he undertook upon
his life (as dear unto him as the crown of England unto her
Majesty, that Ι may use his own words) if it fell not out
accordingly.

Myself at this instant liker to die than to live, by a mis-
chance, could not follow this confident opinion οἱ our refiner
to my own satisfaction; but afterward demanding our Gen-
real's opinion therein, and to have some part of the ore, he
repHed, Content yourself, I have seen enough,· and were it
but to satisfy my private humour, I would proceed no further.
The promise unto my friends, and necessity to bring also the
south countries within compass of my patent near expired, as
we have already done these north parts, do only persuade
me further. And touching the ore, I have sent it aboard,
whereof I would have no speech to be made so long as we
remain within harbour; here being both Portugals, Biscay-
ans, and Frenchmen, not far off, from whom must be kept
any bruit or muttering of such matter. When we are at sea,
proof shall be made‚· if it be our desire, we may return the
sooner hither again. Whose answer Ι judged reasonable,
and contenting me well; wherewith Ι will conclude this nar·
