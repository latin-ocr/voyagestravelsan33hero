256 DRAKE’S FAMOUS VOYAGE

our keeping the sea-wash shore missed the greatest part
of them very happily.

Ι overpass many particular matters, as the hurting of
Captain Sampson at sword blows in the first entering, unto
whom was committed the charge of the pikes of the vant-
guard by his lot and turn; as also of the taking οῖ’ Alonzo
Bravo, the chief commander of that place, by Captain
Goring, after the said captain had first hurt him with his
sword; unto which captain was committed the charge of the
, shot of the said vant-guard. Captain Winter was likewise
by his turn of the Vaut-guard in this attempt, where also
the Lieutenant-General marched himself3 the said Captain
Winter, through a great desire to serve by land, having
now exchanged his charge at sea with Captain Cecil for
his band of footmen. Captain Powell, the sergeant-Major,

the battle. Captain Morgan, who at St. Domingo was of the
vant-guard, had now by turn his charge upon the companies
of the rearward. Every man, as well of one part as of an-
other, came so willingly on to the service, as the enemy was
not able to endure the fury of such hot assault.

We stayed here six weeks, and the sickness with mortality
before spoken of still continued among us, though not with
the same fury as at the first; and such as were touched with
the said sicknesS, escaping death, very few or almost none
could recover their strength. Yea, many of them were much
decayed in their memory‚ insomuch that it was grown an
ordinary judgment, when one was heard to speak foolishly,
to say he had been sick of the calentura, which is the Spanish
name of their burning ague3 for, as Ι told you before, it is a
very burning and pestilent ague. The original cause thereof
is imputed to the evening or first night air, which they term
Ζα seren& wherein they say and hold very firm opinion
that whoso is then abroad in the open air shall certainly
be infected to the death, not being of the Indian or natural
race of those country people. By holding their watch our
men were thus subjected to the infectious air, which at
Saafztiago was most dangerous and deadly of all other places.

With the inconvenience of continual mortality we were
forced to give over our¹ intended enterprise to go with
