282 GILBERT’S VOYAGE

opened until occasion required, whereby every man was
certified what to leave for instruction of after comers; that
every of us coming into any harbour or river might know
who had been there, or whether any were still there up
higher into the river, or departed, and which way.

Orders thus determined, and promises mutually given to
be observed, every man withdrew himself unto his charge;
the anchors being already weighed, and our ships under
sail, having a soft gale of wind, we began our voyage upon
Tuesday, the 11. day of June, in the year of our Lord 1583,
having in our fieet (at our departure from Cawset Bay)
these ships, whose names and burthens, with the names οἱ
the captains and masters of them, I have also inserted, as

tons, was Admiral; in which went the General, and William

Raleigh, οἱ the burthen of 200 tons, was then Vice-Admira13

Bristol, master. 3. The Golden Hind, of burthen 40 tons,
was then Rear—Admira1; in which went Edward Hagyes, cap-

4. The Swallow, of burthen 40 tons; in her was captain
Maurice Browne. 5. The Squirrel, of burthen 10 tons3 in
which went captain William Andrews, and one C ade, master.

carpenters, smiths, and such like, requisite to such an aeti0n;
also mineral men and refiners. Besides, for solace oi our
people, and allurement of the savages, we were provided of
music in good variety ; not omitting the least toys, as mortis-
dancers, hobby-horse, and May—like conceits to delight the
savage people‚ whom we intended to win by all fair means
possible. And to that end we were indifferently furnished
, of all petty haberdashery wares to barter with those simple
people.

In this manner we set forward, departing (as hath been
said) out of Cawset Bay the 11. day of June, being Tuesday,
the weather and wind fair and good all day; but a great
