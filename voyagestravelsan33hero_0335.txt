DISCOVERY OF GUIANA 327

undertake there was never any prison in England that could
be found more unsavoury and loathsome, especially to my-
self, who had for many years before been dieted and cared
for in a sort far more differing.

11· Captain Preston had not been persuaded that he should
have come too late to Trinidad to have found us there (for
the month was expired which I promised to tarry for him
there ere he could recover the coast of Spain) but that it
had pleased God he might have joined with us, and that we
had entered the country but some ten days sooner ere the
rivers were overflown‚ we had adventured either to have
gone to the great city of Manoa, or at least taken so many
of the other cities and towns nearer at hand, as would have
made a royal return. But it pleased not God so much to
favour me at this time. If it shall be my lot to prosecute
the same, Ι shall willingly spend my life therein. And if
any else shall be enabled thereunto, and conquer the same,
I assure him thus much3 he shall perform more than ever
was done in M exico by C orteS, or in Peru by Pizarro, where-
οἱ the one conquered the empire of Mutezuma, the other of
Guascar and Atabalipa. And whatsoever prince shall possess
it, that prince shall be lord of more gold, and of a more beau-
tiful empire, and of more cities and people, than either the
king of Spain or the Great Turk.

But because there may arise many doubts, and how this
empire of Guiana is become so populous, and adorned with
so many great cities, towns, temples, and treasures, I thought
good to make it known, that the emperor now reigning is
descended from those magnificent princes of Peru, of whose
large territories, of whose policies, conquests, edifices, and
riches, Pedro de Ciam, Francisco Lopea, and others have
written large discourses. For when Francisco Pizarro,
Diego Almagro and others conquered the said empire of
Peru, and had put to death Atabalipa‚ son to Guayna Capac,
which Atabalipa had formerly caused his eldest brother
Guascar to be slain, one of the younger sons of Guayna
Capac fled out of Peru, and took with him many thousands
of those soldiers of the empire called orejones‚¹⁰ and with

²⁰ Oreiones?⁸ having large earS‚’ the name given by the Spaniards to the
Peruvian wax-nors, who wore ear-pendants.
