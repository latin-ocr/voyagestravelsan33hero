THIRD VOYAGE 183

Cimaroons would also then stand fast and firm, so faithful
are they to their captain. He being very glad of his reso-
lution, gave our Captain his hand, and vowed that “He
would rather die at his foot, than leave him to the enemies,
if he held this course.”

So having strengthened ourselves for the time, we took
our journey towards Venta Cruz, with help of the mules
till we carne within a mile of the town, where we turned
away the Recuas, charging the conductors of thern, not to
