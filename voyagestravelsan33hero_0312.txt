304 GILBERT'S VOYAGE

Leave that to me, he replied, I will ask a penny of no man.
I will bring good tidings unto her Majesty, who will be so

gracious to lend me {10,ooo; willing us therefore to be of -

good cheer; for he did thank God, he said, with all his heart
for that he had seen, the same being enough for us all, and
that we needed not to seek any further. And these last words
he would often repeat, with demonstration of great ferveney
of mind, being himself very confident and settled in belief
of inestimable good by this voyage; which the greater
number of his followers nevertheless mistrusted altogether,
not being made partakers of those secrets, which the Gen-
eral kept unto himself. Yet all of them that are living may
· be witnesses of his words and protestations, which sparingly
I have delivered.

Leaving the issue of this good hope unto God, who know-
eth the truth only, and can at His good pleasure bring the
same to light, I will hasten to the end of this tragedy, which
must be knit up in the person of our General. And as it
was God's ordinance upon him, even so the vehement per-
suasion and entreaty of his friends could nothing avail to
divert him of a wilful resolution of going through in his
frigam which was overcharged upon the decks with fights‚
nettings‚ and small artillery, too cumbersome for so small a
boat that was to pass through the ocean sea at that season
of the year, when by course we might expect much storm of
foul weather. Whereof, indeed, we had enough.

But when he was entreated by the captain, master, and
other his well-willers of the Hind not to venture in the
frigam, this was his answer: I will not forsake my little
company going homeward, with whom I have passed so
many storms and perils. And in very truth he was urged
to be so over hard by hard reports given of him that he
was afraid of the sea3 albeit this was rather rashness than
advised resolution, to prefer the wind of a vain report to
the weight of his own life. Seeing he would not bend to
reason, he had provision out of the Hind, such as was want-
ing aboard his frigate. And so we committed him to God·s
protection, and set him aboard his pinnace‚ we being more
than 300 leagues onward of our way home.

By that time we had brought the Islands of Azores south
