EGYPT 69

to her very great riches, considering that the tithe of her
wealth may still be seen even to this time by any one who
desires it: for Rhodopis wished to leave behind her a me-
morial of herself in Hellas, namely to cause a thing to be
made such as happens not to have been thought of or dedi-
cated in a temple by any besides, and to dedicate this at
Delphi as a memorial of herself. Accordingly with the tithe
of her wealth she caused to be made spits of iron of size
large enough to pierce a whole ox, and many in number,
going as far therein as her tithe allowed her, and she sent
thern to Delphi: these are even at the present time lying
there, heaped all together behind the altar which the Chians
dedicated, and just opposite to the cell of the temple. Now
at Naucratis, as it happens, the courtesans are rather apt to
win credit; for this woman first, about whom the story to
which I refer is told, became so famous that all the Hellenes
without exception came to know the name of Rhodopis, and

building besides, this has them very much more than the rest.
In this king’s reign they told me that, as the circulation of
money was very slow, a law was made for the Egyptians
that a man might have that money lent to him which he
needed, by offering as security the dead body of his father;
and there was added moreover to this law another, namely
that he who lent the money should have a claim also to the
whole of the sepulchral chamber belonging to him who re-
ceived it, and that the man who offered that security should
be subject to this penalty, if he refused to pay back the
debt, namely that neither the man himself should be allowed
to have burial, when he died, either in that family burial-
place or in any other, nor should he be allowed to bury any
