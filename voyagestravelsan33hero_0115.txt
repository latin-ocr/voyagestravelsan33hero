nasty3 and thus grow into those limbs‚ into that bulk,
which with marvel we behold. They are all nourished with
the milk of their own mothers, and never surrendered to
haudmaids and nurses. The lord you cannot discern from
the slave, by any superior delicacy in rearing. Amongst
the same cattle they promiscuously live, upon the same
ground they without distinction lie, till at a proper age the
free—born are parted from the rest, and their bravery recom-
mend them to notice. Slow and late do the young men
come to the use of women, and thus very long preserve the
vigour of youth. Neither are the virgins hastened to wed.
They must both have the same sprightly youth, the like
stature, and marry when equal and able-bodied. Thus the
robustness of the parents is inherited by the children.
Children are holden in the same estimation with their
mother’s brother, as with their father. Some hold this
tie of blood to be most inviolable and binding, and in re-
ceiving of hostages, such pledges are most considered and
claimed, as they who at once possess affections the most
unalienable, and the most diffuse interest in their family.
To every man, however, his own children are heirs and suc-
cessors: wills they make none: for want of children his
next akin inherits; his own brothers, those of his father,
γ or those of his mother. To ancient men, the more they
abound in descendants, in relations and affinsties, so much
the more favour and reverence accrues. From being child-
less, no advantage nor estimation is derived.

All the enmities of your house, whether of your father
or of your kindred‚ you must necessarily adopt; as well as
all their friendships. Neither are such enmities unap-
peasable and permanent: since even for so great a crime
as homicide, compensation is made by a fixed number of
sheep and cattle, and by it the whole family is pacified to
content. A temper this, wholesome to the State; because
to a free nation, animosities and faction are always more
menacing and perilous. In social feasts, and deeds of
hospitality, no nation upon earth was ever more liberal and
abounding. To refuse admitting under your roof any
man whatsoever, is held wicked and inhuman. Every man
receives every comer, and treats him with repasts as large
