18 HERODOTUS

this country it is a voyage os about four days in length, and
in this part the Nile is winding like the river Maiander‚ and
the distance amounts to twelve schoines, which one must
traverse in this manner. Then you will corne to a level
plain, in which the Nile flows round an island named
Tachompso. (Now in the regions above Elephantine there
dwell Ethiopians at once succeeding‚ who also occupy half
of the island, and Egyptians the other half.) Adjoining
this island there is a great lake, round which dwell
Ethiopian nomad tribes: and when you have sailed through
this you will come to the stream of the Nile again, which
flows into this lake. After this you will disembark and make
a journey by land of forty days; for in the Nile sharp rocks
stand forth out of the water, and there are many mess, by
which it is not possible for a vessel to pass. Then after
having passed through this country in the forty days which
I have said, you will embark again in another vessel and
sail sor twelve days; and after this you will come to a great

they greatly honour; and they have an Oracle of Zeus
established, and make warlike marches whensoever this
god commands them by prophesyings and to whatsoever
place he commands. Sailing from this city you will corne to
the “Deserters'' in another period of time equal to that
in which you carne from Elephantine to the mother-city
of the Ethiopians. Now the name of these “Deserters”
is Asmach, and this word signifies, when translated into
the tongue os the Hellenes, “those who stand on the left
hand of the king.'’ These were two hundred and forty
thousand Egyptians of the warrior class, who revolted and
went over to these Ethiopians for the following cause :—
In the reign of Psammetichos garrisons were set, one
towards the Ethiopians at the city of Elephantine, another
towards the Arabians and Assyrians at Daphnai of Pelu-
sion, and another towards Libya at Marea: and even in
my own time the garrisons of the Persians too are ordered
in the same manner as these were in the reign of Psam-
metichos, for both at Elephantine and at Daphnai the
