16 HERODOTUS

length, thus it ist—the Sun passing in his course by the
upper parts of Libya, does thus, that is to say, since at
all times the air in those parts is clear and the country is
warm, because there are no cold winds, in passing through
it the Sun does just as he was wont to do in the summer,
when going through the midst oi the heaven, that is he
draws to himself the water, and having drawn it he drives
it away to the upper parts of the country, and the winds
take it up and scattering it abroad melt it into rain; so it
is natural that the winds which blow from this region,
namely the South and South-west Winds, should be much
the most rainy of all the winds. 1 think however that the
Sun does not send away from himself all the water of the
Nile of each year, but that he also lets some remain behind
with himself. Then when the winter becomes milder, the
Sun returns back again to the midst of the heaven, and
from that time onwards he draws equally from all rivers;
but in the meanwhile they fiow in large volume, since water
of rain mingles with them in great quantity, because their
country receives rain then and is filled with torrent streams.
In ‘summer however they are weak, since not only the
showers of rain fail then, but also they are drawn by the
Sun. The Nile however, alone of all rivers, not having rain
and being drawn by the Sun, naturally flows during this
time of winter in much less than its proper volume, that is
much less than in summer ; for then it is drawn equally
with all the other waters, but in winter it bears the burden
alone. Thus I suppose the Sun to be the cause of these
things. He also is the cause in my opinion that the air in
these parts is dry, since he makes it so by scorching up his
path through the heaven: thus summer prevails always in
the upper parts of Libya. If however the station of the
seasons had been changed, and where now in the heaven
are placed the North Wind and winter, there was the
station of the South Wind and of the midday, and
where now is placed the South Wind, there was the North,
if this had been so, the Sun being driven from the midst of
the heaven by the winter and the North Wind would go to
to the upper parts of Europe, just as now he comes to the
upper parts of Libya, and passing in his course through-
