232 DRAKE’S FAMOUS VOYAGE

being made some of bone, some of Hom, and some of brass,
the lightest whereof, by our estimation‚ weighed two ounees
apiece. With this people linen-cloth is good merchandise,
and of good request; whereof they make rolls for their
heads, and girdles to wear about them. Their island is both
rich and fruitfuh rich in gold, silver, copper, and sulphur,
wherein they seem skilful and expert, not only to try the
same, but in working it also artificially into any form and
fashion that pleaseth them. Their fruits be divers and
plentiful3 as nutmegs, ginger, long pepper, lemom, cucum-
bers, cocos, figit, sagn, with divers other sorts. And among
all the rest we had one fruit, in bigness, form and husk, like a
, bay berry, hard of substance and pleasant of taste, which being
sodden becometh soft, and is a most good and wholesome
victual; whereof we took reasonable store, as we did also of
the other fruits and spices. So that to confess a truth, since
the time that we first set out of our own country of England,
we happened upon no place, Ternate only excepted, wherein
we found more comforts and better means of refreshing.

At our departure from Barateve, we set our course for
J ava Major? where arriving‚ we found great courtesy, and ,
honourable entertainment. This island is governed by five
kings, whom they call Rajah; as Rajczh Donaw, and Rajah
Mang Bange, and Rajah Cabuccapoilo, which live as having
one spirit and one mind. Of these five we had four a-shipboard
at once, and two or three often. They are wonderfully de-
lighted in coloured clothes, as red and green ; the upper
part of their bodies are naked, save their heads, whereupon
they wear a Turkish roll as do the Maluccians. From the
middle downward they wear a pintado of silk, trailing upon
the ground, in colour as they best like. The Maluccians hate
that their women should be seen of strangers; but these offer
them of high courtesy, yea, the kings themselves. The peo-
ple are of goodly stature and warlike, well provided of
swords and targets, with daggers, all being of their own
work, and most artificially done, both in tempering their
metal, as also in the form; whereof we bought reasonable
store. They have an house in every village for their com-
mon assembly; every day they meet twice, men, women, and
