GERMANY 12³

Germans, use the same attire‚ build like them, and live like
thern, in that dirtiness and sloth so common to all. Some-
what they are corrupted into the fashion of the Sarmatians
by the inter-marriages of the principal sort with that nation:
from whence the Venedians have derived very many of their
customs and a great resemblance. For they are continually
traversing and infesting with robberies all the forests and
mountains lying between the Peucinians and Fennians.
Yet they are rather reckoned amongst the Germans, for that
they have fixed houses, and carry shields, and prefer travel-
ling on foot, and excel in swiftness. Usages these, all
widely differing from those of the Sarmatians, who live
on horseback and dwell in waggons. In wonderful savage-
ness live the nation of the Fennians, and in beastly poverty‚
destitute of arms, of horses, and of homes; their food, the
common herbs; their apparel, skins; their bed, the earth;
their only hope in their arrows, which for want of iron
they point with bones. Their common support they have
from the chase, women as well as men; for with these the
former wander up and down, and crave a portion of the
prey. Nor other shelter have they even for their babes,
against the violence of tempests and ravening beasts‚ than
to cover thern with the branches of trees twisted together;
this a reception for the old men, and hither resort the
young. Such a condition they judge more happy than the
painful occupation of cultivating the ground, than the labour
of rearing houses, than the agitations of hope and sear at-
tending the defence of their own property or the seizing
that of others. Secure against the designs of men, secure
against the malignity of the Gods, they have accomplished
a thing of infinite difficulty3 that to them nothing remains
even to be wished.

What further accounts we have are fabulous. as that the
Hellusians and Oxiones have the countenances and aspect of
men, with the bodies and limbs of savage beasts. This, as a
thing about which I have no certain information,1 shall

leave untouched.
