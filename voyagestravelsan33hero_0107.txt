dour of their racc, in that of generals by their bravery.
Neither is the power of their kings unbounded or arbitrary:
and their generals procure obedience not so much by the
force of their authority as by that of their example, when
they appear enterprising and brave, when they signalise
themselves by courage and prowess; and if they surpass
all in admiration and pre-eminence, if they surpass all at

and maims they carry to their mothers‚ or to their wives,
neither are their mothers or wives shocked in telling, or
in sucking their bleeding sores.⁸ Nay, to their husbands
and sons whilst engaged in battle, they administer meat and
encouragement.

In history we find, that some armies already yielding and
ready to fly, have been by the women restored, through
their inflexible importunity and entreaties, presenting their
breasts, and showing their impending captivity; an evil
to the Germans then by far most dreadful when it befalls
their women. So that the spirit of such cities as amongst
their hostages are enjoined to send their damsels of quality,
is always engaged more effectually than that of others.
They even believe them endowed with something celestial
