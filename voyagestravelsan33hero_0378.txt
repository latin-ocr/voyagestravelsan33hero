plains adjoining, and the rest of the province of Canurv‘.
Ι sent also Captain WMcfflon, William Connock, and some
eight shot with them, to see if they could find any mineral
stone alongst the river's side. When we were come to the
tops ot* the first hills οἱ the plains adjoining to the river,
we beheld that wonderful breach of waters which ran down
Caroli; and might from that mountain see the river how
it ran in three parts, above twenty miles off, and there ap-

high over the other as a church tower, which fell with that
fury, that the rebound of water made it seem as if it had

had no means but with our daggers and fingers to tear them
out here and there, the rocks being most hard of that
mineral spar aforesaid, which is like a flint, and is altogether
as hard or harder‚ and besides the veins lie a fathom or
two deep in the rocks. But we wanted all things requisite
save only our desires and good will to have performed more
