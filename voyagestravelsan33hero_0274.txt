266 DRAKE’S FAMOUS VOYAGE

sent thither the year before by Sir Walter Raleigh, and
brought them aboard; by whose direction we proceeded
along to the place which they make their port. But some
of our ships being of great draught, unable to enter, an-
chored without the harbour in a wild road at sea, about two
miles from shore. From whence the General wrote letters
to Master Ralph Lane, being governor ot' those English in
Virginia, and then at his fort about six leagues from the
road in an island which they called Roanoac; wherein
especially he shewed how ready he was to supply his neces-
sities and wants, which he understood of by those he had
first talked withal.

The morrow after, Master Lane himself and some of his
company coming unto him, with the consent of his captains
he gave them the choice of two offers, that is to say: either
he would leave a ship, a pinnace, and certain boats with
Δ, sufficient masters and mariners, together furnished with a
month’s victual, to stay and make further discovery οῖ’ the
country and coasts, and so much victual likewise as might
be sufficient for the bringing of them all (being an hundred
and three persons) into England, if they thought good after
such time, with any other thing they would desire, and that
he might be able to spare: or else, if they thought they had
made sufficient discovery already, and did desire to return
into England, he would give thern passage. But they, as it
seemed, being desirous to stay, accepted very thankfully and
with great gladness that which was offered first. Where-
upon the ship being appointed and received into charge by
some of their own company sent into her by Master Lane,
before they had received from the rest of the fleet the pro-
vision appointed them, there arose a great storm (which
they said was extraordinary and very strange) that lasted
three days together, and put all our fleet in great danger to
be driven from their anchoring upon the coast ; for we brake
many cables‚ and lost many anchors; and some of our fleet
which had lost all, of which number was the ship appointed
for Master Lane and his company, were driven to put to sea
in great danger, in avoiding the coast, and could never see
us again until we met in England. Many also of our small
pinnaces and boats were lost in this storm.
