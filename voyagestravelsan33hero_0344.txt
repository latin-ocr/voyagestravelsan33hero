336 SIR WALTER RALEIGH

eost. Ι took one Captain George, a Spaniard, that followed
Gonzalez in this enterprise. Gonzalez gave his daughter to
Berreo, taking his oath and honour to follow the enterprise
to the last of his substance and life. Who since, as he hath
sworn to me, hath spent 3oo‚ooo ducats in the same, and yet
never could enter so far into the land as myself with that
poor troop, or rather a handful of men, being in all about 100
gentlemen, soldiers, rowers, boat-keepers‚ boys, and of all
sorts; neither could any of the forepassed undertakers, nor
Berreo himself, discover the country, till now lately by con-
ference with an ancient king, called Campana? he got the
true light thereof. For Berreo came about 1,5oo miles yere
he understood aught, or could find any passage or entrance
into any part thereof; yet he had experience of all these
fore-named, and divers others, and was persuaded of their
errors and mistakings. Berreo sought it by the river Cassa-
nar‚ which falleth into a great river called Poto: Pato
falleth into Meta, and Meta into Baraqztan, which is also
called Orenoque. He took his journey from Nuevo Reyno
de Granada, where he dwelt, having the inheritance of Gon-
zalez Ximenes in those parts 3 he was followed with 700
horse, he drove with him 1‚ooo head of cattle, he had also
many women, Indians, and slaves. How all these rivers
cross and encounter, how the country lieth and is bordered,
the passage of Ximenes and Berreo, mine own discovery,
and the way that Ι entered, with all the rest of the nations
and rivers, your lordship shall receive in a large chart or
map, which I have not yet finished, and which I shall most
humbly pray your lordship to secrete, and not to suffer it to
pass your own hands; for by a draught thereof all may be
prevented by other nations; for Ι know it is this very year
sought by the French, although by the way that they now
take, Ι fear it not much. It was also told me yere Ι departed
Englmzd, that Villiers‚ the Admiral‚ was in preparation for
the planting of Amwous, to which river the French have
made divers voyages, and returned ²¹ much gold and other
rarities. Ι spake with a captain of a French ship that came
