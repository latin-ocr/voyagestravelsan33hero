318 SIR WALTER RALEIGH

There were on this discovery no less than an hundred persons.
who can all witness that when we passed any branch of the river
to view the land within, and stayed from our boats but six
hours, we were driven to wade to the eyes at our return; and
if we attempted the same the day following, it was impossible
either to ford it, or to swim it, both by reason of the swiftness,
and also for that the borders were so pestered with fast woods‚
as neither boat nor man could find place either to land or to
embark; for in June, July, August, and September it is irn—
possible to navigate any of those rivers; t'or such is the fury
of the current, and there are so many trees and woods overflown‚
as if any boat but touch upon any tree or stake it is impossible
to save any one person therein. And ere we departed the land it
ran with such swiftness as we drave down, most commonly
against the wind, little less than an hundred miles a day. Resides.
our vessels were no other than wherries, one little barge, a small
wok-boat, and a bad yaliota which we framed in haste for that
purpose at Trinidad; and those little boats had nine or ten men
apiece, with all their victuals and arms. It is further true that
we were about four hundred miles from our ships, and had
been a mouth from them, which also we left weakly manned
in an open road, and had promised our return in fifteen days.

Others have devised that the same ore was had from Barbam,
and that we carried it with us into Gaiana. Surely the singularity
of that device Ι do not well comprehend. For mine own part, I
am not so much in love with these long voyages as to devise
thereby to cozen myself, to lie hard, to fare worse, to be sub-
jected to perils, to diseases, to ill savours, to be parched and
withered, and withal to sustain the care and labour of such an
enterprise‚ except the same had more comfort than the fetching
of marcas-ite in Guiona, or buying of gold ore in Barbam). But
Ι hope the better sort will judge me by themselves, and that the
way of deceit is not the way of honour or good opinion. I have
herein consumed much time, and many crowns; and I had no
² other respect or desire than to serve her Maiesty and my country
thereby. If the Spanish nation had been of like belief to these
detractors we should little have feared or doubted their attempts,
wherewith we now are daily threatened. But if we now consider
of the actions both of charles the F iftlz, who had the maidenhead
of Peru and the abundant treasures of Atabalz‘pa, together with
