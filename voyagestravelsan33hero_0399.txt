DISCOVERY OF GUIANA 391

St. Juan de Puerto Ric0,· and so it falleth out in that navi-
gation every year for the most part. Which in this voyage
are not to be feared; for the time of year to leave England
is best in July, and the summer in Gaiana is in October,
November, December, January, February, and March, and
then the ships may depart thence in April, and so return
again into England in June. So as they shall never be sub-
ject to winter weather, either coming, going, or staying
there: which, for my part, Ι take to be one of the greatest
comforts and encourage-:ments that can be thought on, having,
as I have done, tasted in this voyage by the West Indies so
many calms, so much heat, such outrageous gum, such
weather, and contrary winds.

To conclude, Guiana is a country that hath yet her
maidenhead‚ never sacked‚ turned, nor wrought; the face of
the earth hath not been torn, nor the virtue and salt of the
soil spent by manurance. The graves have not been opened
for gold, the mines not broken with sledges, nor their images
pulled down out of their temples. It hath never been entered
by any army of strength, and never conquered or possessed
by any Christian prince. It is besides so defensible, that if
two forts be builded in one of the provinces which I have
seen, the flood setteth in so near the bank, where the charmel
also lieth, that no ship can pass up but within a pike's length
of the artillery, first of the one, and afterwards of the other.
Which two forts will be a sufficient guard both to the empire
of Inga, and to an hundred other several kingdoms, lying
within the said river, even to the city of Quito in Peru.

There is therefore great difference between the easiness
of the conquest of Gaiana, and the defence of it being con-
quered, and the W est οι· East Iud-ies. Gaiana hath but one
entrance by the sea, if it hath that, for any vessels of burden.
So as whosoever shall first possess it, it shall be found un-
accessible for any enemy, except he come in wherries, barges,
or canoas, or else in flat-bottomed boats; and if he do offer
to enter it in that manner, the woods are so thick 200 miles
together upon the rivers of such entrance, as a mouse cannot
sit in a boat unhit from the bank. By land it is more im-
possible to approach; for it hath the strongest situation of
any region under the sun, and it is so environed with im-
