EGYPT 81

and Artemis are children of Dionysos and of Isis, and that
Leto became their nurse and preserver; and in the Egyptian
tongue Apollo is Oros, Demeter is Isis, and Artemis is
Bubastis. From this story and from no other AEschylus
the son of Euphorion took this which 1 shall say, wherein
he differs from all the preceding poets; he represented
namely that Artemis was the daughter of Demeter. For
this reason then, they say, it became a floating island.

Such is the story which they te11; but as for Psamme-
tichos‚ he was king over Egypt for four-and-fifty years, of
which for thirty years save one he was sitting before Azotos,
a great city of Syria, besieging it, until at last he took it:
and this Azotos of all cities about which we have knowledge
held out for the longest time under a siege.

The son of Psammetichos was Necos‚ and he became king
of Egypt. This man was the first who attempted the channel
leading to the Erythraian Sea, which Dareios the Persian
afterwards completed: the length of this is a voyage of four
days, and in breadth it was so dug that two triremes could
go side by side driven by oars3 and the water is brought into
it from the Nile. The channe] is conducted a little above
the city of Bubastis by Patumos the Arabian city, and runs
into the Erythraian Sea: and it is dug first along those parts
of the plain of Egypt which lie towards Arabia, just above
which run the mountains which extend opposite Memphis,
where are the stone-quatries,—along the base of these
mountains the channel is conducted from West to East for
a great way; and after that it is directed towards a break
in the hills and tends from these mountains towards the
noon—day and the South Wind to the Arabian gulf. Now
in the place where the journey is least and shortest from the
Northern to the Southern Sea (which is also called
Erythraian)‚ that is from Mount Casion, which is the
boundary between Egypt and Syria, the distance is exactly
a thousand furlongs to the Arabian gulf ; but the channel is
much longer, since it is more winding3 and in the reign of
Necsss there perished while digging it twelve myriads of the
Egyptians, Now Necos ceased in the midst of his digging,
because the utterance of an Oracle impeded him, which was
to the effect that he was working for the Barbarian: and the
