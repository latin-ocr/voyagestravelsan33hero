EGYPT 65

they proceeded to finish that which came next to them, and
lastly they finished the parts of it near the ground and the
lowest ranges. On the pyramid it is declared in Egyptian
writing how much was spent on radishes and onions and
leeks for the workmen, and if I rightly remember that which
the interpreter said in reading to me this inscription, a sum
of one thousand six hundred talents of silver was spent;
and if this is so, how much besides is likely to have been ex-
pended upon the iron with which they worked, and upon
bread and clothing for the workmen, seeing that they were
building the works for the time which has been mentioned
and were occupied for no small time besides, as I suppose,
in the cutting and bringing of the stones and in working at
the excavation under the ground? Cheops moreover came,
they said, to such a pitch of wickedness‚ that being in want
of money he caused his own daughter to sit in the stews‚ and
ordered her to obtain from those who came a certain amount
of money (how much it was they did not tell me) ; and she
not only obtained the sum appointed by her father, but also
she formed a design for herself privately to leave behind
her a memorial, and she requested each man who carne in to
her to give her one stone upon her building: and of these
stones‚ they told me, the pyramid was built which stands in
front of the great pyramid in the middle of the three, each
side being one hundred and fifty feet in length.

after he was dead his brother Chephren succeeded to the
kingdom. This king followed the same manner of dealing
as the other, both in all the rest and also in that he made a
pyramid, not indeed attaining to the measurements of that
which was built by the former (this I know, having myself
also measured it), and moreover there are no underground
chambers beneath nor does a channel come from the Nile
flowing to this one as to the other, in which the water com-
ing through a conduit built for it flows round an island
within, where they say that Cheops himself is laid: but for
a basement he built the first course of Ethiopian stone of
divers colours; and this pyramid he made forty feet lower
than the other as regards size, building it close to the great
pyramid. These stand both upon the same hill, which is
