GERMANY 111

That the Gauls were in times past more puissant and for—
midable, is related by the Prince of authors, the deified
Julius ;⁷ and hence it is probable that they too have passed
into Germany. For what a small obstacle must be a river,
to restrain any nation, as each grew more potent, from seiz-
ing or changing habitations; when as yet all habitations
were common, and not parted or appropriated by the found-
ing and terror of Monarchies? The region therefore be-
tween the Hercynian Forest and the rivers Moenus8 and
Rhine, was occupied by the Helvetians; as was that beyond
it by the Boiam, both nations of Gaul. There still remains
a place called Boiemum‚ which denotes the primitive name
and antiquity of the country, although the inhabitants have
been changed. But whether the Araviscans are derived
from the Osians, a nation of Germans passing into Pan-
nonia, or the Osians from the Araviscans removing from
thence into Germany, is a matter undecided; since they both
still use the language, the same customs and the same laws.
For, as of old they lived alike poor and alike free, equal
proved the evils and advantages on each side the river, and
common to both people. The Treverians and Nervians as—
pire passionately to the reputation of being descended from
the Germans; since by the glory of this original, they would
escape all imputation of resembling the Gauls in person and
effeminacy. Such as dwell upon the bank of the Rhine. the
Vangiones, the Tribocians‚ and the Nemetes, are without
doubt all Germans. The Ubians are ashamed of their orig-
inal; though they have a particular honour to boast, that of
having merited an establishment as a Roman Colony‚ and still
delight to be called Agrippinensians, after the name of their
founder: they indeed formerly came from beyond the Rhine,
and, for the many proofs of their fidelsty, were settled upon
the very bank of the river; not to be there confined or
guarded themselves, but to guard and defend that boundary
against the rest of the Germans.

Of all these nations, the Batavians are the most signal in
bravery. They inhabit not much territory upon the Rhine,
but possess an island in it. They were formerly part of the
Cattans‚ and by means of feuds at home removed to these
