EGYPT 41

finished eating, a man bears round a wooden figure of a dead
body in a coffin, made as like the reality as may be both by
painting and carving, and measuring about a cubit or two
cubits each way; and this he shows to each of those who are
drinking together, saying: “When thou lookest upon this,
drink and be merry, for thou shalt be such as this when thou
art dead.’' Thus they do at their carousals. The customs
which they praecise are derived from their fathers and they
do not acquire others in addition; but besides other customary
things among them which are worthy of mention, they have
one song, that of Linos, the same who is sung of both in

” Phenicia and in Cyprus and elsewhere, having however a

name different according to the various nations. This song
agrees exactly with that which the Hellenes sing calling on
the name of Linos, so that besides many other things- about
which Ι wonder among those matters which concern Egypt,
Ι wonder especially about this, namely whence they got the
song of Linos. It is evident however that they have sung
this song from immemorial time, and in the Egyptian tongue
Linos is called Maneros. The Egyptians told me that he
was the only son of him who first became king of Egypt, and
that he died before his time and was honoured with these
lamentations by the Egyptians, and that this was their first
and only song. In another respect the Egyptians are in
agreement with some of the Hellenes, namely with the
Lacedemonians, but not with the rest, that is to say, the
younger of them when they meet the elder give way and
move out of the path, and when their elders approach, they
rise out of their seat. In this which follows however they
are not in agreement with any of the Hellenes,-—instead of
addressing one another in the roads they do reverence‚ lower-
ing their hand down to their knee. They wear tunics of
linen about their legs with fringes, which they call calasiris,·
above these they have garments of white wool thrown over:
woolen garments however are not taken into the temples,
nor are they buried with them, for this is not permitted by
religion. In these points they are in agreement with the
observances called Orphic and Bacchic (which are really
Egyptian), and also with those of the Pythagoreans, for one
who takes part in these mysteries is also forbidden by re-
