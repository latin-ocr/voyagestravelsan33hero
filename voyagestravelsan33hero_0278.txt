INTRODUCTORY NOTE

Sm HUMPHREY GILBERT, the founder of the first Enqlifh colony
in North America, was born about 1539, the son of a Devonshire
gentlemam whose widow afterward married the father of Sir
Walter Raleiyh. He was educated at Eton and Oxford‚ served
under Sir Philip Sidney’s father in Ireland, and fouyht for the
Netherlands against Spain. After his return he composed a
pamphlet uryiny the search for a northwest passaye to Cathay,
which led to Frobisher's license for his explorations to that end.

In 1578 Gilbert obtained from Queen Elieabeth the charter he
had long] souyht, to plant a colony in North America. His first
attempt failed, and eost him his whole fortune; but, after further
service in Ireland, he sailed again in 1583 for Newfoundland. In
the August of that year he took possession of the harbor of St.
John and founded his colony, but on the return voyaye he went
down with his ship in a storm south of the Azores.

The followinq narrative is an account of this last voyage of
Gilbert’s, told by Edward Hayes, commander of “The Golden
Hind‚” the only one to reach Engyland of the three ships which
set out from Newfoundland with Gilbert.

The settlement at St. John was viewed by its promoter as
merely the beginning of a scheme for oustiny Spain from
America in favor of Enyland. The plan did not proyress as
he hoped,· but after lony delays, and under far other impulses
than Gilbert ever thought of, much of his dream was realized.
