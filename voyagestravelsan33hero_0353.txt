DISCOVERY OF GUIANA 345

others they took the uncle of Moreqm'to, called Topiawari,
who is now king of Ammaia, whose son Ι brought with me
into England, and is a man of great understanding and
policy ; he is above an hundred years old, and yet is of a very
able body. The Spaniards led him in a chain seventeen days,
and made him their guide from place to place between his
country and Emeria, the province of Campana aforesaid,
and he was at last redeemed for an hundred plates of gold,
and divers stones called piedras hijadas, or spleen-stones.
Now Berreo for executing of M orequiw, and other cruelties‚
spoils, and slaughters done in Ammaia, hath lost the love
of the Orenoqueponi, and of all the borderers, and dare not

have great hope, endeavouring by all means to establish
him in the said province. Among many other trades, those
Spaniards used canoas to pass to the rivers of Barema,
Pawroma, and Dissequebe,³⁶ which are on the south side
of the mouth of Orenoque, and there buy women and
children from the cannibals‚ which are of that barbarous
nature, as they will for three or four hatchets sell the sons
and daughters of their own brethren and sisters, and for
somewhat more even their own daughters, H'ereof the
Spaniards make great profit; for buying a maid of twelve
or thirteen years for three or four hatchets‚ they sell them
again at Margarita in the West Indies for fifty and an
hundred pesos, which is so many crowns.

The master of my ship, John Douglas, took one of the
canoas which came laden from thence with people to be
sold, and the most of thern escaped; yet of those he brought,
