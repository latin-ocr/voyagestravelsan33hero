This they say, and they do in honour of Perseus after Hel-
lenic sashion thus,-they hold an athletic contest, which in-
cludes the whole list of games, and they offer in prizes cattle
and cloaks and skins: and when I inquired why to them
alone Perseus was wont to appear, and wherefore they were
separated from all the other Egyptians in that they held an
athletic contest, they said that Perseus had been born of
their city, for Danaos and Lynkeus were men of Chemmis
and had sailed to Hellas, and from them they traced a
descent and came down to Perseus: and they told me that he
had come to Egypt for the reason which the Hellenes also

then visited them also and recognised all his kinsfolk, and
they said that he had well learnt the name of Chemmis
before he came to Egypt, since he had heard it from his
mother, and that they celebrated an athletic contest for him
by his own command.

All these are customs practised by the Egyptians who

in respect of food they have invented these things besides :—

flooded, there grow in the water great numbers of lilies,
which the Egyptians call lot0s; these they cut with a sickle
and dry in the sun, and then they pound that which grows
in the middle of the lotos and which is like the head of a
poppy, and they make of it loaves baked with fire. The root
also of this lotos is edible and has a rather sweet taste: it is
round in shape and about the size of an apple. There are
other lilies too, in flower resembling roses, which also grow
in the river, and from them the fruit is produced in a sepa-
rate vessel springing from the root by the side of the plant
itself, and very nearly resembles a wasp’s comb: in this there
grow edible seeds in great numbers of the size of an olive-
* stone, and they are eaten either fresh or dried. Besides this
