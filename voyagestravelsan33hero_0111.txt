GERMANY 103

too is the emulation amongst these followers‚ of each to
be first in favour with his Prince; mighty also the emula-
tion of the Princes, to excel in the number and valour of
followers. This is their principal state, this their chief
force, to be at all times surrounded with a huge band of
chosen young men, for ornament and glory in peace, for
security and defence in war. Nor is it amongst his own
people only, but even from the neighbouring communities,
that any of their Princes reaps so much renown and a name
so great, when he surpasses in the number and magna-
nimity of his followers. For such are courted by Em-
bassies, and distinguished with presents, and by the terror
of their fame alone often dissipate wars.

In the day of battle, it is scandalous to the Prince to
be surpassed in feats of bravery, scandalous to his followers
to fail in matehing the bravery of the Prince. But it is
infamy during life, and indelible reproaeh, to return alive
‘from a battle where their Prince was slain. To preserve
their Prince, to defend him, and to ascribe to his glory all
their own valorous deeds, is the sum and most sacred part of
their oath. The Princes fight for victory; for the Prince
his followers fight. Many of the young nobility, when their
own community comes to languish in its vigour by long
peace and inactivity, betake themselves through impatienee
to other states which then prove to be in war. For, besides
that this people cannot brook repose, besides that by perilous
adventures they more quickly blazon their fame, they can-
not otherwise than by violence and war support their huge
train of retainers. For from the liberality of their Prince,
they demand and enjoy that war-horse of theirs, with that
victorious javelin dyed in the blood of their enemies. In
the place of pay, they are supplied with a daily table and
repasts3 though grossly prepared, yet very profuse. For
maintaining such liberality and munificence, a fund is fur-
nished by continual wars and plunder. Nor could you so
easily persuade them to cultivate the ground, or to await
the return of the seasons and produce of the year, as to
provoke the foe and to risk wounds and death: since stupid
and spiritless they account it, to acquire by their sweat what
they can gain by their blood.
