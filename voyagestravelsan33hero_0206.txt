198 SIR FRANCIS DRAKE

At length GOD gave them the sight of two pinnaces
turning towards them with much wind; but with far greater
joy to him than could easily conjecture, and did cheerfully
declare to those three with him, that “they were our pin-
naces! and that all was sate, so that there was no cause of
sear! '’

But see, the pinnaces not seeing this raft, nor suspecting
any such matter, by reason of the wind and night growing
on, were forced to run into a cove behind the point, to take
succour, for that night: which our Captain seeing, and
gathering (because they came not forth again), that they
would anchor there, put his raft ashore, and ran by land
about the point, where he found them; who, upon sight of
him, made as much haste as they could to take him and his
company aboard. For our Captain (of purpose to try what
haste they could and would make in extremity)‚ himself ran
in great haste, and so willed the other three with him; as if
they had been chased by the enemy: which they the rather
suspected, because they saw so few with him.

And after his coming aboard, when they demanding
“ How all his company did? ” he answered coldly, “ Well! '¹
They all doubted [feared] that all went scarce well. But he
willing to rid all doubts, and fill them with joy, took out of
his bosom a quoit of gold, thanking GOD that “ our voyage
was madel''

And to the Frenchmen he declared, how their Captain
indeed was left behind, sore wounded and two of his com-
pany with him: but it should be no hindrance to them.

That night (4th April) our Captain with great pain of his
company, rowed to Rio Francisco: where he took the rest
in, and the treasure which we had brought with us: making
such expedition, that by dawning of the day, we set sail back
again to our frigate, and from thence directly to our ships:
where, as soon as we arrived, our Captain divided by weight,
the gold and silver into two even portiom, between the
French and the English.

About a fortnight after, when we had set all things in
order, and taking out of our ship [the Pascha] all such
necessaries as we needed for our frigate, had left and given
