DISCOVERY OF GUIANA 315

despised, so great riches and so mighty an empire refused3 I hope
her Maiesty will yet take my humble desire and my labour
therein in gracious part, which, if it had not been in respect of
her Highness' future honour and riches, could have laid hands
on and ransomed many of the kings and caciqui of the country,
and have had a reasonable proportion of gold for their redemp-
tion. But I have chosen rather to bear the burden of poverty
than reproach; and rather to endure a second travail, and the
chanees thereos, than to have defaced an enterprise of so great
assurance, until Ι knew whether it pleased God to put a disposi-
tion in her princely and royal heart either to follow or forslow²
the same. Ι will therefore leave it to His ordinance that hath
only power in all things; and do humbly pray that your honours
will excuse such errors as, without the defence of art, overrun
in every part the following discourse, in which I have neither
studied phrase, form, nor fashion; that you will be pleased to
esteem me as your own, though over dearly bought, and I shall
ever remain ready to do you all honour and service.
