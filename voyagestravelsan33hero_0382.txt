374 SIR WALTER RALEIGH

Anebas. Above Amapaia, toward N uevo Reyno, sall in Meto,
Pato and Cassanar. To the west of those, towards the prov-
inces of the Ashaguas and Catetios, are the rivers of Beta,'
Dawney‚ and Ubarr0; and toward the frontier of Peru are
the provinces of Thomebamba, and Caxamalca. Adjoining
to Quito in the north side of Peru are the rivers of Guiacar
and Goauar; and on the other side os: the said mountains the
river of Papamene which descendeth into M αναῆοη or Ama-
zons, passing through the province Motilones, where Don
Pedro de Orsda, who was slain by the traitor Aguirre be-
fore rehearsed, built his brigandines, when he sought Guiana
by the way of Amazons.

Between Dawney and Beta lieth a famous island in Ore-
noque (now called Baraquan, for above Meta it is not known
by the name of Orenoque) which is called Αίῖιτιῖιῑῇ8 beyond
which ships of burden cannot pass by reason of a most
forcible overfall, and current of water; but in the eddy all
smaller vessels may be drawn even to Peru itself. But to
speak of more οἱ these rivers without the description were
but tedious, and therefore Ι will leave the rest to the de-
scription. This river of Orenoque is navigable for ships
little less than 1‚ooo miles, and for lesser vessels near 2‚ooo.
By it, as aforesaid, Peru, Nuevo Reyno and Popayan may be
invaded: it also leadeth to the great empire of Iuga, and to
the provinces of Amapaia and Ambos, which abound in
gold. His branches of Casmero, Monta, Caura descend from
the middle land and valley which lieth between the easter
province of Peru and Guiana3 and it falls into the sea be-
tween Marathon and Trinidad in two degrees and a half.
All of which your honours shall better perceive in the
general description of fficiam, Peru, Nuevo Reyno, the king-
dom of Popaycm, and Rodas, with the province of Venezuelffl
to the bay of Uraba, behind cartag-ena, westward‚ and to
Amazons southward. While we lay at anchor on the coast
of Canmi, and had taken knowledge of all the nations upon
the head and branches of this river, and had found out so
many several people‚ which were enemies to the Epuremei
and the new conquerors, Ι thought it time lost to linger any
longer in that place, especially for that the fury of Orenoque
