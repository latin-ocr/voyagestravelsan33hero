78 HERODOTUS

Now the twelve kings continued to rule justly, but in'
course of time it happened thus 1-—After sacrifice in the
temple of Hephaistos they were about to make libation on
the last day of the feast, and the chief-priest, in bringing
out for them the golden cups with which they had been
wont to pour libations, missed his reckoning and brought
eleven only for the twelve kings. Then that one of them
who was standing last in order, namely Psammetichos,
since he had no cup took off from his head his helmet, which
was of bronze, and having held it out to receive the wine
he proceeded to make libation: likewise all the other kings

afterwards, when he was king, it was his fate to be a fugitive
a second time on account of the helmet, being driven by the
eleven kings into the fen-country. So then holding that he
had been grievously wronged by them, he thought how he
might take vengeance on those who had driven him out:
and when he had sent to the Oracle of Leto in the city of
Buto, where the Egyptians have their most truthful Oracle,
there was given to him the reply that vengeance would come
when men of bronze appeared from the sea. And he was
strongly disposed not to believe that bronze men would come
to help him; but after no long time had passed, certain
