ROUND THE WORLD 219

entered the port, we found there three small barks‚ which we
rifled‚ and found in one of them fifty-seven wedges of silver‚
each of thern weighing about 20 lb. weight, and every of
these wedges were of the fashion and bigness of a brickbat.
In all these three barks, we found not one person. For
they, mistrusting no strangers‚ were all gone a-land to the
town, which consisteth of about twenty houses3 which we
would have ransacked if our company had been better and

thence towards Panama; whom our General still pursued,
and by the way met with a bark laden with ropes and tackle
for ships, which he boarded and searched, and found in her
80 lb. weight of gold, and a crucifix of gold with goodly
great emeralds set in it, which he took, and some of the
