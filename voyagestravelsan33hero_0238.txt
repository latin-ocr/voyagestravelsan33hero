230 DRAKE’S FAMOUS VOYAGE

neck he had a chain of perfect gold, the links whereof
were great, and one sold double. On his fingers he had six
very fair jewels; and sitting in his chair of state, at his right
hand stood a page with a fan in his hand, breathing ancl
gathering the air to the king. The same was in length two
foot, and in breadth one foot, set with eight sapphires richly
embroidered, and knit to a staff three foot in length, by the
which the page did hold and mov'e it. Our gentlernen hav-

whose bodies being no bigger than our common English

had been a burning candle. In this place breedeth also
wonderful store of bats, as big as large hens. Of cray-
fishes also here wanted no plenty, and they of exceeding big-
