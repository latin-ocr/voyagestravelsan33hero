260 DRAKE'S FAMOUS VOYAGE

armed, because they made account with their ordnance to
have taken the barks well enough at sea; which they might
full easily have done, without any loss at all, if they had
come in time to the harbour mouth, before the Spaniards'
boats had gotten so near the shore.

During our abode in this place, as also at St. Domingo,
there passed divers courtesies between us and the Spaniards,
as feasting, and using them with all kindness and favour; so
as amongst others there came to see the General the gov-
ernor of C arthagena, with the bishop of the same, and divers
other gentlemen of the better sort. This town of Carthagena
we touched in the out parts, and consumed much with fire,
as we had done 5 t. Domingo, upon discontentments, and for

The warning which this town received of our coming to-

fore our arrival here, was cause that they had both fortified
and every way prepared for their best defence. As also
that they had carried and conveyed away all their treasure
and principal substance.

The ransom of 110,ooo ducats thus concluded on, as is
aforesaid, the same being written, and expressing for
nothing more than the town of Carthageaw, upon the pay-
ment of the said ransom we left the said town and drew
sorne part of our soldiers into the priory or abbey, standing
a quarter of an English mile below the town upon the har-
