4ο HERODOTUS

Egyptians, and the Egyptians also agree that it is for this
reason that they honour these birds. The outward form of
the ibis is thisz—it is a deep black all over, and has legs like
those of a crane and a very curved beak, and in size it is
about equal to a rail: this is the appearance of the blaek
kind which fight with the serpents, but of those which most
crowd round men’s feet (for there are two several kinds of
ibises) the head is bare and also the whole of the throat‚ and
it is white in feathering except the head and neck and the
extremities of the wings and the rump (in all these parts of
which Ι have spoken it is a deep blaek), while in legs and in
the form ot* the head it resembles the other. As for the
serpent its form is like that of the watersnake; and it has

Of the Egyptians themselves, those who dwell in the part of

after the Libyans (in my opinion on account of the seasons,
because the seasons do not change, for by the changes of
things generally, and especially of the seasons, diseases are
most apt to be produced in men), and as to their diet, it is
' as follows z—they eat bread, making loaves of maize, which
they call kyllestis‚ and they use habitually a wine made out
of barley, for vines they have not in their land. Of their
fish some they dry in the sun and then eat them without
cooking, others they eat cured in brine. Of birds they eat
quails and ducks and small birds without cooking, after first
curing them ; and everything else which they have belonging
to the class of birds or fishes‚ except such as have been set
apart by them as sacred, they eat roasted or boiled. In the
entertainments of the rich among them, when they have
