woof upwards, the Egyptians push it downwards: the men
carry their burdens upon their heads and the women upon
their shoulders: the women make water standing up and
the rnen crouching down: they ease themselves in their houses
and they eat without in the streets, alleging as reason for
this that it is right to do secretly the things that are unseem-
ly though necessary, but those which are not unseemly, in
public: no woman is a minister either of male or female
divinity, but men of all, both male and female: to support

those whom the matter concerns most nearly have their hair
cut short, but the Egyptians, when deaths occur, let their

bread of maize, which some call spelt: they knead dough
with their feet and clay with their hands, with which also
they gather up dung: and whereas other men, except such
as have learnt otherwise from the Egyptians, have their
members as nature made them, the Egyptians practice cir-
cumcision: as to gau-ments, the nien wear two each and the
women but one: and whereas others make fast the rings
and ropes of the sails outside the ship‚ the Egyptians do
this inside: finally in the writing of characters and reckon-
ing with pebbles‚ while the Hellenes carry the hand from
the left to the right, the Egyptians do this from the right to
the left3 and doing so they say that they do it themselves
rightwise and the H'ellenes leftwise: and they use two kinds
of characters for writing, of which the one kind is called
sacred and the other common.

They are religious excessively beyond all other men,
and with regard to this they have customs as follows :—
