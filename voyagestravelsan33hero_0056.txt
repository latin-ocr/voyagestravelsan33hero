shore: down-stream however they travel as follows z—they
have a door-shaped crate made of tamarisk wood and reed
mats sewn together, and also a stone of about two talents
weight bored with a hole; and of these the boatman lets the
crate float on in front of the boat, fastened with a rope,
and the stone drags behind by another rope. The crate then,
as the force of the stream presses upon it, goes on swiftly
and draws on the baris (for so these boats are called), while
the stone dragging after it behind and sunk deep in the
water keeps its course straight. These boats they have in
great numbers and some of them carry many thousands of
talents' burden.

When the Nile comes over the land, the cities alone are
seen rising above the water, resembling more nearly than
anything else the islands in the Egean Sea; for the rest of
Egypt becomes a sea and the cities alone rise above water,
Accordingly, whenever this happens, they pass by water not
now by the channels of the river but over the midst of the
plain: for example, as one sails up from Naucratis to Mem-
phis the passage is then close by the pyramids, whereas the
usual passage is not the same even here, but goes by the
point of the Delta and the city of Kercasoros; while if you
sail over the plain to Naucratis from the sea and from
Canobos, you will go by Anthylla and the city called after
Archander. Of these Anthylla is a city of note and is
especially assigned to the wife of him who reigns over Egypt,
to supply her with sandals‚ (this is the case since the time
when Egypt came to be under the Persians): the other city
seems to me to have its name from Archander the son-in-law
of Danaos, who was the son of Phthios‚ the son of Achaios;
for it is called the City of Archander. There might indeed
be another Archander, but in any case the name is not
Egyptian.

Hitherto my own observation and judgment and inquiry
are the vouchers for that which Ι have said; but from this
point onwards I am about to tell the history of Egypt ac-
cording to that which I heard, to which will be added also
something of that which I have myself seen.
