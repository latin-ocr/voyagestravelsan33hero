three-quarters of an hour.

This storm was no sooner ceast, but it became very calm,
and therewith there came such an innumerable multitude
of a kind of flies of that country, called mosquitoes, like
our gnats, which bite so spstefully, that we could not rest
all that night, nor find means to defend ourselves from them,
by reason of the heat of the country. The best remedy
we then found against them, was the juice of lemons.

At the break of day (9th Sept), we departed‚ rowing
in the eddy, and hauling up by the trees where the eddy
