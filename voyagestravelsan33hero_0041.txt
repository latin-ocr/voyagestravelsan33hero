EGYPT 33

memory of him3 and after this, when she got understanding
of the Hellenic tongue, she established an Oracle, and she
reported, I suppose, that her sister had been sold in Libya
by the same Phenicians by whom she herself had been sold.
Moreover, I think that the women were called doves by the
people of Dodona for the reason that they were Barbarians
and because it seemed to them that they uttered voice like
birds; but after a time (they say) the dove spoke with human
voice, that is when the woman began to speak so that they
could understand; but so long as she spoke a Barbarian
tongue she seemed to them to be uttering voice like a bird:
for if it had been really a dove, how could it speak with
human voice? And in saying that the dove was black‚ they
indicate that the woman was Egyptian. The ways of deliver-

Egypt; now Isis is in the tongue of the Hellenes Demeter:

Athene, fourthly at Heliopolis for the Sun (Helios), fifthly
at the city of Buto in honour of Leto, and sixthly at the city
of Papremis for Ares. Now, when they are coming to the
city of Bubastis they do as follows z—-they sail men and
women together, and a great multitude of each sex in every
boat; and some of the women have rattles and rattle with
them, while some of the men play the flute during the whole
time of the voyage, and the rest, both women and men, sing
and clap their hands ; and when as they sail they come
opposite to any city on the way they bring the boat to land, ἱ
