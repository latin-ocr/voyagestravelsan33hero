THIRD VOYAGE 199

her to the Spaniards, whom we had all this time detained, we
put out oi that harbour [at Fort Diego, p. 160] together with
the F rench ship, riding some few days among the Cabecas.

In the meantime, our Captain made a secret composition
with the Cimaroons, that twelve of our men and sixteen of
theirs, should make another voyage, to get intelligence in
what case the country stood ; and if it might be, recover
Monsieur TETU, the French Captain3 at leastwise to bring
away that which was hidden in our former surprise, and
could not then be conveniently carried.

JOHN OXNAM and THOMAS SHERWELL were put in trust
for his service, to the great content of the whole company,

would have cast down his pillage‚ and laid aside his covetous
mind. As for the silver‚ which we had hidden thereabout in
the earth and the sands, he thought that it was all gone: for
that he thought there had been near two thousand Spaniards
and Negroes there to dig and search for it.

{Phis report notwithstanding, our purpose held, and our
men were sent to the said place, where they found that the
earth, every way a mile, distant had been digged and turned
