EGYPT 67

Mykerinos was enamoured of his own daughter and after-
wards ravished her; and upon this they say that the girl
strangled herself for grief, and he buried her in this cow;
and her mother cut off the hands of the maids who had
betrayed the daughter to her father; wherefore now the
images of thern have suffered that which the maids suffered
in their life. In thus saying they speak idly‚ as it seems to
me, especially in what they say about the hands of the
statues ; for as to this, even we ourselves saw that their
hands had dropped off from lapse of time, and they were to
be seen still lying at their fect even down to my time. The

and the neck, which are seen, overlaid with gold very thickly ;
and between the horns there is the disc of the sun figured in

it is equal to a large living cow. Every year it is carried
forth from the chamber‚ at those times, I say, the Egyptians
beat themselves for that god whom I will not name upon

and he being indignant at it sent to the Oracle a reproach
against the god, making complaint in reply that whereas his
father and uncle, who had shut up the temples and had not
only not remembered the gods, but also had been destroyers of
men, had lived for a long time, he himself, who practised
piety, was destined to end his life so soon: and from the
Oracle there came a second message‚ which said that it was
for this very cause that he was bringing his life to a swift
close; for he had not done that which it was appointed for
him to do, since it was destined that Egypt should suffer evils
for a hundred and fifty years, and the two kings who had
arisen before him had perceived this, but he had not. Myk—
erinos having heard this, and considering that this sentence
had passed upon him beyond recall, procured many lamps,
