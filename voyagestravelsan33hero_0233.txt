ROUND THE WORLD 225

crown‚ and dignity of the said country into his hands wish-
ing that the riches and treasure thereos might so con-
veniently be transported to the enriching of her kingdom at
home, as it aboundeth in the same.

The common sort of people, leaving the king and his
guard with our General, scattered themselves together with
their sacrifices among our people, taking a diligent view of
every person: and such as pleased their fancy (which were
the youngest), they enclosing them about offered their
sacrifices unto them with lamentable weeping, scratching and
tearing their flesh from their faces with their nails, whereof
issued abundance of blood. But we used signs to them of
disliking this, and stayed their hands from force, and
directed them upwards to the living God, whom only they
ought to worship. They shewed unto us their wounds, and
craved help of them at our hands; whereupon we gave them
lotions‚ plaisters, and ointments agreeing to the state of their

griefs‚ beseeching God to cure their diseases. Every third Ἴ

day they brought their sacrifices unto us, until they under-
stood our meaning, that we had no pleasure in them; yet

they could not be long absent from us, but daily frequented ·

our company to the hour of our departure, which departure
seemed so grievous unto them, that their joy was turned into
sorrow. They entreated uS, that being absent we would re-
member them, and by stealth provided a sacrifice, which we
misliked.

Our necessary business being ended, our General with
his company travelled up into the country to their villages‚
where we found herds of deer by a thousand in a company,
being most large, and fat of body. We found the whole
country to be a warren of a strange kind of coneys; their
bodies in bigness as be the Barbary coneys, their heads as the
heads of oum, the feet of a want‚²³ and the tail of a rat,
being of great length. Under her chin is on either side a
bag, into the which she gathereth her meat, when she hath
filled her belly abroad. The people eat their bodies, and
make great account of their skins, for their king's coat was
made of them. Our General called this country Nova Al-
bion, and that for two causes; the one in respect of the

²³ Mole.
