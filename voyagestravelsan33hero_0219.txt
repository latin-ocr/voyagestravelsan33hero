ROUND THE WORLD 211

'resistance; which we found to be a good prize, and she
yielded unto us good store of wine. Which prize our
General committed to the custody of Master Doughty; and
retaining the pilot, sent the rest away with his pinnace, giv-
ing them a butt of wine and some victuals‚ and their wearing
clothes, and so they departed. The same night we came with
the island called by the Portugals Ilha do Fogo, that is, the
burning island3 in the north side whereof is a consuming fire.
The matter is said to be of sulphur, but, notwithstanding, it
is like to be a commodious island, because the Portugals
have built, and do inhabit there. Upon the south side there-
οἱ lieth a most pleasant and sweet island, the trees whereof
are always green and fair to look upon, in respect whereof
they call it Ilha Brava, that is, the brave island. From
the banks thereos into the sea do run in many places reason-
able streams of fresh water easy to come by, but there was
no convenient road for our ships; for such was the depth
that no ground could be had for anchoring. And it is
reported that ground was never found in that place; so
that the tops of Fogo burn not so high in the air, but the
roots of Brava are quenched as low in the sea.

Being departed from these islands, we drew towards
the line, where we were becalmed the space of three weeks,
but yet subject to divers great storms, terrible lightnings and
much thunder. But with this misery we had the commodity
of great store of fish, as dolphins, bonitos, and flying—fishes,
whereof some fell into our ships; wherehence they could
not rise again for want of moisture, for when their wings are
dry they cannot fly.

From the first day of our departure from the islands
of Cape Verde, we sailed 54 days without sight of land.
And the first land that we fell with was the coast of Brazil,
which we saw the fifth of April, in the height of 33 degrees
towards the pole Antarctic. And being discovered at sea
by the inhabitants of the country, they made upon the coast
great fires for a sacrifice (as we learned) to the devils:
about which they use conjurations, making heaps of sand, and
other ceremonies‚ that when any ship shall go about to stay
upon their coast, not only sands may be gathered together in
shoals in every place, but also that storms and tempests may
