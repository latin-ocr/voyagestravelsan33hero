106 TACITUS

woman may not suppose herself free from the considera-
tions of fortitude and fighting, or exempt from the
casualties of war, the very first solemnities of her wedding
serve to warn her, that she comes to her husband as a
partner in his hazards and fatigues, that she is to suffer
alike with him, to adventure alike, during peace or during
war. This the oxen joined in the same yoke plainly indi-
cate, this the horse ready equipped, this the present of
arms. 'Tis thus she must be content to live, thus to resign

have but one body and one life, they take but one husband,
that beyond him they may have no thought, no further
wishes, nor love him only as their husband but as their
marriage.⁶ To resti-ain generation and the increase of
children, is esteemed an abominable sin, as also to kill
infants newly born. And more powerful with them are
