DISCOVERY OF GUIANA 323

called Jajo, those at Punta de Carao are of the Arwacas:
and between Carao and Curiapan they are called Salvajos.
Between Carao and Punta de Galera are the Nepojos, and
those about the Spanish city term themselves Carinepagotes.⁷
Of the rest of the nations‚ and of other ports and rivers, Ι
leave to speak here, being impertinent to my purpose, and
mean to describe them as they are situate in the particular
plot and description of the island, three parts whereot' Ι
coasted with my barge, that Ι might the better describe it.

Meeting with the ships at Puerto de los Espanoles, we
found at the landing-place a company of Spaniards who
kept a guard at the descent; and they offering a sign of
peace, Ι sent Captain Whiddon to speak with thern, whom
afterwards to my great grief I left buried in the said island
after my return from Guzana, being a man most honest and
valiant. The Spaniards seemed to be desirous to trade with
us, and to enter into terms of peace, more for doubt of their
own strength than for aught else; and in the end, upon
pledge, some of them came aboard. The same evening
there stale also aboard us in a small canoa two Indians, the
one of them being a cacique or lord ot* the people‚ called
Cantyman, who had the year before been with Captain Whid-
don, and was οἱ his acquaintance. By this Cantyman we
understood what strength the Spaniards had, how far it was
to their city, and of Don Antonio de Berreo, the governor,
who was said to be slain in his second attempt of Gaiana,
but was not.

While we remained at Puerto de los Espafioles some
Spaniards earne aboard us to buy linen of the company, and
such other things as they wanted, and also to view our ships
and company, all which I entertained kindly and feasted
after our manner. By means whereof Ι learned of one and
another as much of the estate of Guiana as Ι could, or as
they knew; for those poor soldiers having been many years
without wine, a few draughts made them merry, in which
mood they vaunted of Guiana and the riches thereos, and all
what they knew of the ways and passages; myself seeming
to purpose nothing less than the entrance or discovery there-
os, but bred in them an opinion that I was bound only for

⁸ Arawaks. '¹ Carib-people.
