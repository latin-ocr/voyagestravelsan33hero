THIRD VOYAGE 175

as they could carry, and time permitted. One day as we
travelled, the Cimaroons t'ound an otter, and prepared it to be
drest: our Captain marvelling at it, Pamin, our chief. Cima·
roon, asked him, “ Are you a man of war, and in want; and
yet doubt whether this be meat, that hath blood? '’

Herewithal our Captain rebuked himself secretly, that he
had so slightly considered of it before.

The third day of our journey (6th February), they brought
us to a town of their own, seated near a fair river, on the side
of a hill, environed with a dyke of eight feet broad, and a
thick mud wall of ten feet high, sufficient to stop a sudden
surpriser. It had one long and broad street, lying east and
west, and two other cross streets of less breadth and length:
there were in it some five or six and fifty households; which
were kept so clean and sweet, that not only the houses, but
the very streets were very pleasant to behold. In this town
we saw they lived very civilly and cleanly. For as soon as
we came thither, they washed themselves in the river; and
changed their apparel, as also their women do wear, which
was very fine and fitly made somewhat after the Spanish
fashion, though nothing so costly. This town is distant thirty-
five leagues from Nombre de Dios and forty-five from Pan-
ama. It is plentit'ully stored with many sorts of beasts and
fowl, with plenty of maize and sundry fruits.

Touching their affection in religion, they have no kind
of priests, only they held the Cross in great reputation. But
at our Captain's persuasion, they were contented to leave
their crosses, and to learn the Lord’s Prayer, and to be in-
structed in some measure concerning GOD’s true worship.
They kept a continual watch in four parts, three miles off
their town, to prevent the mischiefs, which the Spaniards
intend against thern, by the conducting of some of. their own
coats [i.e., CrimaroonsL which having been taken by the
Spaniards have been enforeed thereuntoz wherein, as we
learned, sometimes the Spaniards have prevailed over them,
especially when they lived less careful; but since, they

as often as they take them in the woods; having aforehand
understood of their coming.

We stayed with them that night, and the next day (7th
