378 SIR WALTER RALEIGH

younger years. He therefore prayed us to defer it till the
next year, when he would undertake to draw in all the
borderers to serve us, and then, also, it would be more
seasonable to travel; for at this time of the year we should
not be able to pass any river, the waters were and would be
so grown ere our return.

He farther told me that I could not desire so much to
invade Macureguarai and the rest οἱ Guiana but that the
borderers would be more vehement than Ι. For he yielded
for a chief cause that in the wars with the Epuremei they
were spoiled of their women, and that their wives and
daughters were taken from them3 so as for their own parts
they desired nothing of the gold or treasure for their labours,
but only to recover women from the Epuremei. For he
farther complained very sadly, as it had been a matter of
great consequence, that whereas they were wont to have ten
or twelve wives, they were now enforced to content them-
selves with three or four, and that the lords of the Epuremei
had fifty or a hundred. And in truth they war more for
women than either for gold or dominion. For the lords of
countries desire many children οἱ their own bodies to in-
crease their races and kindreds, for in those consist their
greatest trust and strength. Divers of his followers after-
wards desired me to make haste again, that they might sack
the Epitremei, and I asked them, of what? They answered‚
Of their women for us, and their gold for you. For the
hope of those many of women they more desire the war than
either for gold or for the recovery of their ancient terri-
tories. For what between the subjects of Iuga and the
Spaniards, those frontiers are grown thin of people; and
also great numbers are fled to other nations farther off for
fear of the Spaniards.

After Ι received this answer of the old man, we fell into
consideration whether it had been of better advice to have
entered Macureguarai, and to have begun a war upon Inga
at this time, yea, or no, if the time of the year and all things
else had sorted. For mine own part, as we were not able to
march it for the rivers, neither had any such strength as was
requisite, and durst not abide> the coming of the winter, or
to tarry any longer from our ships, I thought it were evil
