:320 SIR WALTER RALEIGH

of profit to ourselves, or at least be a let and impeachment to the
quiet course and plentiful trades of the Spanish nation3 who,
in my weak judgernent, by such a war were as easily endangered
and brought from his powerfulness as any prince in Europe, if it
be considered from how many kingdoms and nations his revenues
are gathered, and those so weak in their own beings and so far
severed from mutual succour. But because such a preparation
and resolution is not to be hoped for in haste, and that the time
which our enemies embrace cannot be had again to advantage, Ι
will hope that these province-s, and that empire now by me dis-
covered, shall suffice to enable her Maiesty and the whole king-
dom with no less quantities of treasure than the king of Spain
hath in all the Indies, East and West, which he possesseth ; which
if the same be considered and followed, ere the Spaniards enforce
the same, and if her Maiesty will undertake it, I will be cont
tented to lose her Highness’ favour and good opinion for ever,
and my life withal‚ if the same be not found rather to exceed
than to equal whatsoever is in this discourse promised and de·
clared. Ι will now refer the reader to the following discourse‚
with the hope that the perilous and chargeable labours and en-
deavours of such as thereby seek the profit and honour of her
Maiesty, and the English nation, shall by men of quality and
virtue receive such construction and good acceptance as them-
selves would like to be rewarded withal in the like.
