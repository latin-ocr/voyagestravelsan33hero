THIRD VOYAGE 171

hear of the coming of the Spanish Fleet; and therefore set
no more to sea; but supplied his wants, both for his own
company and the Cimaroons, out of his foresaid magazine,
beside daily out of the woods, with wild hogs, pheasants, and
guanas: continuing in health (GOD be praised) all the
meantime, which was a month at least; till at length about
the beginning of January, half a score of our company fell
down sick together (3rd Jan. 1573), and the most of them
died within two or three days. So long that we had thirty
at a time sick of this calenture, which attacked our men,
either by reason of the sudden change from cold to beat,
or by reason of brackish water which had been taken in
by our pinnace, through the sloth of their men in the mou'th ,
of the river, not rowing further in where the water was
good.

Among the rest, Josnpn ΠΒΑΚΕ, another of his brethren‚
died in our Captain’s armS‚ of the same disease: of which,

Captain made of anatomy in this voyage.

The Surgeon that cut him open, over-lived him not past
four days, although he was not touched with that sickness,
of which he had been recovered about a month before: but
only of an over-bold practice which he would needs make
upon himself, by receiving an over-strong purgation of his
own device, after which taken, he never spake; nor his Boy
recovered the health which he lost by tasting it, till he saw
England.

The Cimaroens, who, as is before said, had been enter-
tained by our Captain in September last, and usually repaired
to our ship, during all the time of our absence, ranged the
country up and down, between Nombre de Dios and uS‚
to leam what they might for us; whereof they gave our
Captain advertisement, from time to time; as now partic-
ularly, certain of them let him understand, that the Fleet
had certainly arrived in Nombre de Dios.

Therefore he sent (goth January) the Liou, to the sea-
