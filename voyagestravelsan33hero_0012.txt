4 ' INTRODUCTION

Iosophy of history. The unity which marks his work is due not
only to the stron9 Greek national feeling] runniny throuyh it, the
feeliny that rises to a heiyht in such passages as the descriptions
of the battles of Marathon, Thermopyla and Salamis, but also
to his profound belief in Fate and in Nemesis. To his belief in
Fate is due the frequent quoting] of oracles and their fulfilment,
the frequent references to thinys foreordained by Providence.
The workiny of Nemesis he finds in the disasters that befall men
and nations whose toweriny prosperity awakens the jealousy of
the yods. The final overthrow of the Persians‚ which forms his
main theme, is only one specially conspicuous exam-ple of the
operation of this force from which human life can never free
itself.

But, above all, he is the father of story-tellers. “Herodotus
is such simple and deliyhtful readin9,” says Jevons; “he is so
unaffected and entertaininffi his story flows so naturally and with
such ease that we have a difficulty in bearing] in mind that, over
and above the hard writiny which yoes to make easy reading,
there is a perpetual marvel in the work of Herodotus. It is the
first artistic work in prose that Greek literature produced. This
prose work, which for pure literary merit no subsequent work
has surpassed‚ than which later yenerations, after using the pen
for centuries, have produced no prose more easy or more react-
able, this was the first of histories and of literary prose.'’
