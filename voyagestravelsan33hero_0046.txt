38 HERODOTUS

not so, but they treat them on the contrary as enemies:
those however who dwell about Thebes and about the lake
of Moiris hold them to be most sacred, and each of these two
peoples keeps one crocodile selected from the whole number,
which has been trained to tameness‚ and they put hanging
ornaments of molten stone and of gold into the ears of these
and anklets round the front feet, and they give them food
appointed and victims of sacrifices and treat them as well
as possible while they live, and after they are dead they bury
them in sacred tombs, embalming them: but those who dwell
about the city of Elephantine even eat them, not holding
them to be sacred. They are called not crocodiles but
champsai‚ and the Ionians gave them the name of crocodile,
comparing their form to that of the crocodiles (lizards)
which appear in their country in the stone walls. There are
many ways in use of catching thern and of various kinds:
I shall describe that which to me seems the most worthy of
being told. A man puts the back of a pig upon a hook as

direction of the sound, and when he finds the pig's back he
swallows it down: then they pull, and when he is drawn

hoofed like an ox, flat-nosed, with a mane like a horse and
showing teeth like tusks, with a tail and voice like a horse,
and in size as large as the largest ox; and his hide is so ex-
ceedingly thick that when it has been dried shafts of javelins
are made of it. There are moreover otters in the river, which

A they consider to be sacred; and of fish also they esteern

that which is called the lepidotos to be sacred, and also the
eel; and these they say are sacred to the Nile: and of birds
the fox—goose.

There is also another sacred bird called the phoenix which
