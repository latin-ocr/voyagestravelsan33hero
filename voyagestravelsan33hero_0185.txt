ΤΗΙ RD VOYAGE 177

reason of those goodly and high trees, that grow there so
thick, that it is cooler travelling there under them in that
hot region, than it is in the most parts of England in the
summer time. This [also] gave a special encouragement
unto us all, that we understood there was a great Tree about
the midway, from which, we might at once discern the North
Sea from whence we came, and the South Sea whither we
were gomg.

The fourth day following (11th February) we came to the
height of the desired hill, a very high hill, lying East and
West‚ like a ridge between the two seas, about ten of the
clock: where [PEDRO] the chiefest of these Cimaroons took
our Captain by the hand, and prayed him to follow him, if
he was desirous to see at once the two seas, which he had
so long longed for.

Here was that goodly and great high Tree, in which they
had cut and made divers steps, to ascend up near unto the

“ besought Almighty GOD of His goodness, to give him life
and leave to sail once in an English ship, in that sea! ’' And
then calling up all the rest of our [17 English] men, he
acquainted JOHN OXNAM especially with this his petition and
purpose, if it would please GOD to grant him that happiness.
Who understanding it, presently protested, that “ unless our
Captain did beat him from his company, he would follow
him, by GOD's grace! ’'

Thus all, thoroughly satisfied with the sight of the seas,
