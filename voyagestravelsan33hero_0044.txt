86 HERODOTUS

But if I should say for what reasons the sacred animals have
been thus dedicated, I should fall into discourse of matters
pertaining to the gods, of which I most desire not to speak;
and what I have actually said touching slightly upon them,
I said because I was constrained by necessity. About these
animals there is a custom of this kind :—pe1·sons have been
appointed of the Egyptians, both men and women, to pro-
vide the food for each kind of beast separately, and their
office goes down from father to son; and those who dwell in
the various cities perform vows to them thus, that is, when
they make a vow to the god to whom the animal belongs,
they shave the head ot' their children either the whole or
the half or the third part of it, and then set the hair in the
balance against silver, and whatever it weighs, this the man
gives to the person who provides for the animals, and she
cuts up fish of equal value and gives it for food to the
animals. Thus food for their support has been appointed:
and if any one kill any of these animals, the penalty, if he do
it with his own will, is death, and if against his will, such
penalty as the priests may appoint: but whosoever shall kill
an ibis or a hawk, whether it be with his will or against his
will, must die. Of the animals that live with men there are

take away by force 01· remove secretly the young from the
females and kill them (but after killing they do not eat them),
and the females being deprived of their young and desiring
more, therefore come to the males, for it is a creature that
is fond of its young. Moreover when a fire occur5‚ the cats
seem to be divinely possessed; for while the Egyptians stand
at intervals and look after the cats, not taking any care to
extinguish the fire, the cats slipping through or leaping over
the men, jump into the fire; and when this happens, great
mourning comes upon the Egyptians. And in whatever
houses a cat has died by a natural death, all those who dwell
in this house shave their eyebrows only, but those in whose
houses a dog has died shave their whole body and also their:
