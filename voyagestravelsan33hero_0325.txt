DISCOVERY OF GUIANA 317

white Spar, of which 1 saw divers hills, and in sundry places,
but had neither time nor men, nor instruments fit for labour.
Near unto one of the rivers I found of the said white spar or

flint a very great ledge or bank, which I endeavoured to break ’

by all the means I could, because there appeared on the outside
some small grains of g01d; but finding no mean to work the
same upon the upper part, seeking the sides and circuit of the
said rock, I found a clift in the same, from whence with daggers,
and with the head of an axe, we got out some small quantity
there0f; of which kind of white stone, wherein gold is engen-
dered‚ we saw divers hills and rocks in every part of Guiana
wherein we travelled. Of this there have been made many trials;
and in London it was first assayed by Master Westw00d‚ a refiner
dwelling in Wood S treet, and it held after the rate of twelve or
thirteen thousand pounds a ton. Another sort was afterward
tried by Master Bulmar, and Master Dimock, assay—rnaster; and
it held after the rate of three and twenty thousand pounds a ton.
There was some of it again tried by Master Palmer, Comptroller
of the Mint‚ and Master Dimock in Goldsmith’s Hall, and it held
after six and twenty thousand and nine hundred pounds a ton.
There was also at the same time, and by the same persons, a
trial made of the dust of the said mine; which held eight pounds
and six ounces weight of gold in the hundred. There was like-
wise at the same time a trial of an image of copper made in
Guiana, which held a third part of gold, besides divers trials
made in the country, and by others in London. But because there
came ill with the good, and belike the said alderman was not pre-
sented with the best, it hath pleased him therefore to seandal all
the rest, and to deface the enterprise as much as in him lieth.
It hath also been concluded by divers that if there had been
any such ore in Gaiana, and the same discovered, that I would
have brought horne a greater quantity thereos. First‚ I was
not bound to satisfy any man of the quantity, but only such as
adventured, if any store had been returned thereof; but it is
very true that had all their mountains been of massy gold it was
impossible for us to have made any longer stay to have wrought
the same; and whosoever hath seen with what strength of stone
the best gold ore is environed, he will not think it easy to be
had out in heaps, and especially by us, who had neither men, in-
struments, nor time, as it is said before, to perform the same.
