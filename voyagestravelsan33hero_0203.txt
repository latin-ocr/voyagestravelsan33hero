THIRD VOYAGE 195

When we were come within an English mile of the way,
we stayed all night, resreshing ourselves, in great stillness‚
in a most convenient place: where we heard the carpenters,
being many in number, working upon their ships, as they
usually do by reason of the great heat of the day in Nombre
de Dios; and might hear the mules coming from Panama‚
by reason of the advantage of the ground.

The next morning (1st April), upon hearing of that num-
ber of bells, the Cimaroons, rejoiced exceedingly, as though
there could not have befallen them a more joyful accident
chiefly having been disappointed before. Now they all as-
sured us, “ We should have more gold and silver than all of
us could bear away ”t as in truth it fell out.

For there carne three Recuas, one of 50 mules, the other
two, of 70 each, every [one] of which carried 300 lbs. weight

These three Recuas were guarded with forty-five soldiers
or thereabouts‚ fifteen to each Recua, which caused some ex-
change of bullets and arrows for a time; in which conflict
the French Captain was sore wounded with hail-shot in the
belly‚ and one Cimaroon was slain: but in the end, these
soldiers thought it the best way to leave their mules with us,
and to seek for more help abroad.

In which meantime we took some pain to ease some of the
mules which were heaviest Ioaden of their carriage. And
because we ourselves were somewhat weary, we were con-
tented with a few bars and quoits of gold, as we could well
carry: burying about fifteen tons of silver, partly in the
burrows which the great land crabs had made in the earth,
and partly under old trees which were fallen thereabout‚ and
partly in the sand and gravel of a river, not very deep of
water.

Thus when about this business, we had spent some two
houm, and had disposed of all our matters, and were ready
