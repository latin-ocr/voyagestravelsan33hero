358 SIR WALTER RALEIGH

might have been prevented‚ and all our care taken for
good usage of the people been utterly lost, by those that
only respect present profit; and such violence or insolence
offered as the nations which are borderers would have
changed the desire of our love and defence into hatred and
violence. And for any longer stay to have brought a more
quantity, which I hear hath been often objected, whosoever
had seen or proved the fury of that river after it began to
arise, and had been a month and odd days, as we were,

and women had seen us, and that we gave thern meat, and to
every one something or other which was rare and strange
to them, they began to conceive the deceit and purpose of
the Spaniards, who indeed, as they confessed, took from
thern both their wives and daughters daily . . . But I pro-
test before the Majesty of the living God, that I neither
know nor believe, that any of our company, one or other, did
offer insult to any of their women, and yet we saw many
hundreds, and had many in our power, and of those very
