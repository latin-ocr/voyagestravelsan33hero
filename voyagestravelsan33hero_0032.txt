animal away. But for one who sacrifices a beast not s'ealed
the penalty appointed is death. In this way then the beast
is tested; and their appointed manner of sacrifice is as
follows t—they lead the sealed beast to the altar where they
happen to be sacrificing, and then kindle a fire: after that,
having poured libations of wine over the altar so that it
runs down upon the victim and having called upon the god,
they cut its throat, and having cut its throat they sever
the head from the body. The body then of the beast they
fiay, but upon the head they make many imprecations first,
and then they who have a market and Hellenes sojourning
among them for trade, these carry it to the market-place
and sell it, while they who have no Hellenes among them
cast it away into the river: and this is the form of impre-
cation which they utter upon the heads‚ praying that if any
evil be about to befall either themselves who are offering
sacrifice or the land of Egypt in general, it may come rather
upon this head. Now as regards the heads of the beasts
which are sacrificed and the pouring over them of the wine,
all the Egyptians have the same customs equally for all
their sacrifices; and by reason of this custom none of the
Egyptians eat of the head either of this or of any other
kind of animal: but the manner οἱ disembowelling the vic-
tims and of burning them is appointed among them dif-
ferently for different sacrifices; I shall speak however of
the sacrifices to that goddess whom they regard as the
greatest of all, and to whom they celebrate the greatest
feast—When they have flayed the bulloek and made im-
precation, they take out the whole of its lower entrails but
leave in the body the upper entrails and the fat3 and they
sever from it the legs and the end of the loin and the
shoulders and the neck: and this done, they fill the rest of
the body of the animal with consecrated loaves and honey
and raisins and figs and frankincense and myrrh and every
other kind of spices, and having filled it with these they
offer it, pouring over it great abundance of oil. They
make their sacrifice after fasting, and while the offerings
are being burnt, they all beat themselves for mourning, and
when they have finished beating themselves they set forth
as a feast that which they left unburnt of the sacrifice.
