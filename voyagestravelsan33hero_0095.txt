EGYPT 87

Peloponnesians and not driven out, that is to say the Ar-
cadians, preserved it.

Apries having thus been overthrown, Amasis became
king, being of the district of Sais, and the name of the city
whence he was is Siuph. Now at the first the Egyptians
despised Amasis and held him in no great regard, because
he had been a man of the people and was of no distinguished
family3 but afterwards Amasis won them over to himself
by wisdom and not wilfulness. Among innumerable other

some such words as these: “O king, thou dost not rightly
govern thyself in thus letting thyself descend to behaviour so
trifling3 for thou oughtest rather to have been sitting through-
out the day stately upon a stately throne ancl administering thy
