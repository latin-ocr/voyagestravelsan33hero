EGYPT 77

is built below the water being of Just the same height; and
upon each is placed a colossal statue of stone sitting upon a
chair. Thus the pyramids are a hundred fathoms high; and
these hundred fathoms are equal to a furlong of six hundred
feet, the fathom being measured as six feet or four cubits,
the feet being four palms each, and the cubits six. The
water in the lake does not corne from the place where it is,
for the country there is very deficient in water, but it has
been brought thither from the Nile by a canal; and for six
months the water flows into the lake, and for six months out
into the Nile agaim and whenever it flows out, then for the
six months it brings into the royal treasury a talent of silver
a day from the fish which are caught, and twenty pounds
when the water eomes in. The natives of the place more-
over said that ssns lake had an ousset under ground to the
Syrtis which is in Libya, turning towards the interior of: the
ί, continent upon the Western side and running along by the
mountain which is above Memphis. Now since I did not see
anywhere existing the earth dug out of this excavation (for
that was a matter which drew my attention), Ι asked those
who dwelt nearest to the lake where the earth was which
had been dug out. These told me to what place it had been
carried away; and I readily believed thern, for I knew by
report that a similar thing had been done at Nineveh, the
city of the Assyrians. There certain thieves formed a de-
sign once to carry away the wealth of Sardanapallos son of
Ninos, the king, which wealth was very great and was kept
in treasure—houses under the earth. Accordingly they began
from their own dwelling, and making estimate of their di-
rection they dug under ground towards the king’s palace;
and the earth which was brought out of the excavation they
used to carry away, when night came on, to the river Tigris
which flows by the city of Nineveh, until at last they accom-
plished that which they desired. Similarly, as I heard, the
digging of the lake in Egypt was effected, except that it
was done not by night but during the day; for as they dug
the Egyptians carried to the Nile the earth which was dag
out3 and the river, when it received it, would naturally bear
it away and disperse it. Thus is this lake said to have been

dug out.
