244 DRAKE’S FAMOUS VOYAGE

the valley lying between the aforesaid mountainS, wherein
the town standeth. The said valley and town both do* grow
very narrow; insomuch that the space between the two
cliffs of this end of the town is estimated not to be above
ten or twelve score [yards] over. In the midst of the valley
cometh down a riveret‚ rill, or brook of fresh water, which
hard by the seaside maketh a pond or pool, whereout our
ships were watered with very great ease and pleasure.
- Somewhat above the town on the north side, between the
two mountains, the valley waxeth somewhat larger than at
the town⁷s end; which valley is wholly converted into gar-
dens and orchards, well replenished with divers sorts of
srusts, herbs, and trees, as lemons, oranges, sugat-canes,
cocars or cocos nuts, plantains‚ potato-roms, eucumbers‚
small and round onions, garlic, and some other things not
now remembered. Amongst which the cocos nuts and plan-
tains are very pleasant fruits; the said cocos hath a hard
shell and a green husk over it as hath our walnut, but it far
exceedeth in greatness, for this cocos in his green husk is
bigger than any man’s two fists. Of the hard shell many
drinking cups are made here in England, and set in silver as
Ι have often seen. Next within this hard shell is a white
rind resembling in show very much, even as any thing may
do, to the white of an egg when it is hard boiled. And
within this white of the nut lieth a water, which is whitish
and very clear, to the quantity of half a pint or thereabouts;
which water and white rind before spoken of are both of a
very cool fresh taste, and as pleasing as anything may be.
Ι have heard some hold opinion that it is very restorative.
The plantain groweth in codS‚ somewhat like to beans, but
is bigger and longer, and much more thick together on the
stalk; and when it waxeth ripe, the meat which filleth the
rind of the cod becometh yellow, and is exceeding sweet
and pleasant.

In this time of our being there happened to come a Por-
tugal to the western fort, with a flag of truce. To whom
Captain Sampson was sent with Captain Goring,· who com-
ing to the said messenger, he first asked them, What nation
they were? they answered English'men. He then required
to know if wars were between England and Spain ,ᾖ to which
