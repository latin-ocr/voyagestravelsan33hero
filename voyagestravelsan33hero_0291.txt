ΤΟ NEWFOUNDLAND 283

storm of thunder and wind fell the same night. Thursday
following, when we hailed one another in the evening,
according to the order before specified‚ they signified unto
us out of the Vice-Admiral‚ that both the captain, and very
many of the men, were fallen sick. And about midnight
the Vice-Admiral forsook us, notwithstanding we had the
wind east, fair and good. But it was after credibly re-
ported that they were infected with a contagious sickness,
and arrived greatly distressed at Plymouth; the reason Ι
could never understand. Sure I am, no eost was spared by
their owner, Master Raleigh‚ in setting them forth3 there-
fore I leave it unto God. By this time we were in 48 degrees
of latitude, not a little grieved with the loss of the most
puissant ship in our fleet; after whose departure the Golden
Hind suceeeded in the place of viee-Admiral, and removed
her flag from the mizen into the foretop. From Saturday‚
the 15. of June, until the 28„ which was upon a Friday, we
never had fair day without sog or rain, and winds bad,
much to the west-northwest, whereby we were driven south-
ward unto 41 degrees scarce.

About this time of the year the winds are commonly west
towards the Newfoundland, keeping ordinarily within two
points οἱ west to the south or to the north; whereby the
course thither falleth out to be long and tedious after June,
which in March, April, and May, hath been performed out
of England in 22 days and less. We had wind always so
scant from west—north-west, and from west-south-west again,
that our traverse was great, running south unto 41 degrees
almost, and afterwards north into 51 degrees. Also we
were encumbered with much sog and mists in manner
palpable, in which we could not keep so well together, but
were dissevered, losing the company of the Swallow and
the Squirrel upon the 20. day of July, whom we met again
at several places upon the Newfoundland coast the 3. οἱ
August, as shall be declared in place convenient. Saturday,
the 27. July, we might descry‚ not far from us, as it were
mountains of ice driven upon the sea, being then in 50
degrees, which were carried southward to the weather of

us; whereby may be conjectured that some current doth set
that way from the north.
