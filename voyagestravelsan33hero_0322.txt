314 SIR WALTER RALEIGH

the Indies being, as they are for the most part, so mountainous,
full of woods, rivers, and marishes. In the port towns of the
province of Venezuela, as Cumana, C oro, and St. Iayo (whereof
Coro and S t. layo were taken by Captain Preston, and Cumana
and St. Joseplzo by us) we found not the value of one real of plate
in either. But the eities of Barquasimeta, Valencia, St. Sebastian,
Cororo, St. Lucia, Lawna, Maracazha, and Truxillo, are not so
’ easily invaded. Neither doth the burning of those on the coast
impoverish the king of Spain any one ducat; and if we sack
the River of Hadia, st. Martha, and Carthayena, which are the
ports of Nuevo Reyno and Popayan, there are besides within the
land, which are indeed rich and prosperous‚ the towns and cities
of Merida, Lam'ita, St. christophoro, the great cities of Pam-
plona, Sama F? de Boyota, Tunxa, and M 020, where the emeralds
are found, the towns and cities of Marequita, V elea, la Villa de
Leiva, Palma, Honda, Anyostum the great city of Timana,
Tocaima, S t. Aquila, Pasto, [St] Jayo, the great city of Popayan

lages within the bay of Ura'oa in the kingdom or rivers of Darien
and Caribaaza, the cities and towns of St. Juan de molas, of
Cassaris, of Antiochia, Garamanta, Cati, and Anserma have gold
enough to pay the king's part, and are not easily invaded by
way of the ocean. Or if Nombre de Dios and Panama be taken,
in the province of C astilla del Oro, and the villages upon the rivers
of Cenu and C haara· Peru bath, besides those, and besides the
magnificent cities of Quito and Lima, so many islands‚ ports,
cities, and mines as if I should name thern with the rest it would
seem incredible to the reader. Of all which, because I have
written a particular treatise of the W est Indies, I will omit the
repetition at this time, seeing that in the said treatise I have
anatomized the rest of the sea towns as well of Nicaraqua, Yu-
eatan, Nueva Espafia, and the islands‚ as those of the inland, and
by what means they may be best invaded, as far as any mean
iudgment may comprehend.

But I hope it shall appear that there is a way found to answer
every man's longing3 a better Indies for her Maiesty than the
king of Spain hath any; which if it shall please her Highness
to undertake, I shall most willingly end the rest of my days in
following the same. If it be left to the spoil and sackage of
common persons, if the love and service of so many nations be
