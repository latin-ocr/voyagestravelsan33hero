DISCOVERY OF GUIANA 385

the billow and terrible current of the river. By the next
morning we recovered the mouth of the river of Cumaea,
where we left captain Eynos and Edward Porter to attend
the coming of Captain Keymis overland; but when we en-
tered the same, they had heard no news of his arrival, which
bred in us a great doubt what might become of him. Ι
rowed up a league or two farther into the river, shooting
off pieces all the way, that he might know⁴ of our being
there; and the next morning we heard them answer us also
with a piece. We took thern aboard us, and took our leave
of Putijma‚ their guide, who of all others most lamented our
departure, and offered to send his son with us into Englaud,
if we could have stayed till he had sent back to his town.
But our hearts were cold to behold the great rage and
increase of Orenoque, and therefore [we] departed, and
turned toward the west, till we had recovered the parting of
the three branches aforesaid, that we might put down the
stream after the galley.

The next day we landed on the island of Assapano, which
divideth the river from that branch by which we sent down
to Emeria, and there feasted ourselves with that beast which
is called armadillo, presented unto us before at Winicapora.
And the day following, we recovered the galley at anchor
at the port of Toparimaca, and the same evening departed
with very foul weather‚ and terrible thunder and showerS‚
for the winter was come on very far. The best was, we went
no less than 1oo miles a day down the river; but by the way
we entered it was impossible to return, for that the river
of Amana, being in the bottom of the bay of Guanipa, can-
not be sailed back by any means, both the breeze and current
of the sea were so forcible. And therefore we followed a
branch of Orenoque called Capuri, which entered into the
sea eastward of our ships, to the end we might bear with
thern before the wind; and it was not without need, for we
had by that way as much to cross of the main sea, after we
carne to the river's mouth, as between Gravelin and Dover,
in such boats as your honour hath heard.

To speak of what passed homeward were tedicus, either
