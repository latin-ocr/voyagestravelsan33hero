386 SIR WALTER RALEIGH

to the general map. And to be short, when we were arrived
at the sea-side, then grew our greatest doubt, and the
bitterest of all our Journey forepassed; for I protest before
God, that we were in a most desperate estate. For the same
night which we anchored in the mouth of the river of
Capuri, where it falleth into the sea, there arose a mighty
storm, and the river’s mouth was at least a league broad,
so as we ran before night close under the land with our small
boats‚ and brought the galley as near as we could. But she
had as much ado to live as could be, and there wanted little
of her sinking, and all those in her; for mine own part, I
confess I was very doubtful which way to take, either to go
over in the pestered⁵⁰ galley, there being but six foot water
over the sands for two leagues together, and that also in the
channel, and she drew five; or to adventure in so great a bil-
low, and in so doubtful weather, to cross the seas in my barge.
The longer we tarried the worse it was, and therefore Ι took
Captain Gifford, Captain Caulfield, and my cousin Greenvile
into my barge; and after it cleared up about midnight we put
ourselves to God’s keeping, and thrust out into the sea, leav-
ing the galley at anchor, who durst not adventure but by
daylight. And so, being all very sober and melancholy,
one faintly cheering another to shew courage, it pleased
God that the next day about nine o’clock, we deseried the
island of Trinidad; and steering for the nearest part of it,
we kept the shore till we came to Curiapan, where we found
our ships at anchor, than which there was never to us a more
joyful sight.

Now that it hath pleased God to send us safe to our ships,
it is time to leave Gaiana to the sun, whom they worship,
and steer away towards the north. Ι will, therefore, in a few
words finish the discovery thereos. Of the several nations
which we found upon this discovery Ι will once again make
repetition, and how they are affected. At our first entrance
into Amana, which is one of the outlets of Orenoque, we
left on the right hand of us in the bottom of the bay, lying
directly against Trinidad, a nation of inhuman Cannibals,
which inhabit the rivers of Guanipa and Berbeese. In the
same bay there is also a third river, which is called Areo,

⁵⁰ crowded.
