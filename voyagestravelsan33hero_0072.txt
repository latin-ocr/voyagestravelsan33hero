64 HERODOTUS

Egypt prospered greatly; but after him Cheops became king
over them and brought them to every kind of evil: for he
shut up all the temples, and having first kept them from
sacrifices there, he then bade all the Egyptians work for
him. So some were appointed to draw stones from the
stone-quarries in the Arabian mountains to the Nile, and
others he ordered to receive the stones after they had been
carried over the river in boam, and to draw them to those
which are called the Libyan mountains; and they worked
by a hundred thousand men at a time, for each three months
continually. Of this oppression there passed ten years while
the causeway was made by which they drew the stones,
which causeway they built, and it is a work not much less,
as it appears to me, than the pyramid; sor the length of it
is five furlongs and the breadth ten fathoms and the height,
where it is highest, eight fathoms, and it is made of stone
smoothed and with figures carved upon it. For this they
said, the ten years were spent, and for the underground
chambers 011 the hill upon which the pyramids stand, which
he caused to be made as sepulchral chambers for himself in
an island, having conducted thither a channel from the Nile.
For the making of the pyramid itself there passed a period of
twenty years; and the pryamid is square, each side measuring
eight hundred feet, and the height of it is the same. It is
built of stone smoothed and fitted together in the most per-
fect manner, not one of the stones being less than thirty feet
in length. This pyramid was made after the manner of steps,
which some called “rows'’ and others “bases '’: and when
they had first made it thus, they raised the remaining stones
with machines made of short pieces oftimber, raising them first
from the ground to the first stage of the stepS, and when the
stone got up to this it was placed upon another machine stand-
ing on the first stage, and so from this it was drawn to the
second upon another machine; for as many as were the courses
of the stepS, so many machines there were also, or perhaps
they transferred one and the same machine, made so as
easily to be carried, to each stage successively‚ in order that
they might take up the stones; for let it be told in both
ways, according as it is reported. However that may be,
the highest parts of it were finished first, and afterwards
