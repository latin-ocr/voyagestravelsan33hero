again. But we are assured of the contrary by the prophecy
of Christ, whereby we gather that after His word preached
throughout the world shall be the end. And as the Gospel
when it descended westward began in the south, and after-
ward spread into the north of Europe; even so, as the same
hath begun in the south countries of America, no less hope
may be gathered that it will also spread into the north.

These considerations may help to suppress all dreads rising
of hard events in attempts made this way by other nations‚
as also of the heavy success and issue in the late enterprise
made by a worthy gentleman our countryman, Sir Humfrey
Gilbert, Knight, who was the first of our nation that carried
people to erect an habitation and government in those north-

proceedings in that action; in which the gentleman was so
unfortunately encumbered with wants‚ and worse matched
with many ill-disposed people, that his rare judgment and
regiment premeditated for those affairs was subjected to
tolerate abuses, and in sundry extremities to hold on a course
more to uphold credit than likely in his own conceit happily
to succeed.

The issue of such actions, being always miserable, not
guided by God, who abhorreth confusion and disorder, hath
left this for admonition, being the first attempt by our
nation to plant, unto such as shall take the same cause in
hand hereaster, not to be discouraged from it; but to make
men well advised how they handle His so high and excel-
lent matters, as the carriage is of His word into those very
mighty and vast countries. An action doubtless not to be
