328 SIR WALTER RALEIGH

those and many others which followed him, he vanquished
all that tract and valley of America which is situate between
the great river of Amazons and Baraquan, otherwise called
Orenoque and M amaon?

The empire of Guiana is directly east from Peru towards
the sea, and lieth under the equinoctial line; and it hath
more abundance of gold than any part of Peru, and as many
or m0e²2 great cities than ever Peru had when it flourished
most. It is governed by the same laws, and the emperor
and people observe the same religion, and the same form
and policies in government as were used in Peru, not differ-
ing in any part. And I have been assured by such of the
Spaniards as have seen Manoa, the imperial city of Guiana,
which the Spaniards call El Dorado, that for the greatness‚
for the riches, and for the excellent seat, it far exceedeth
any of the world, at least of so much of the world as is
known to the Spanish nation. It is founded upon a lake of
salt water of 200 leagues long, like unto Mare Caspium.
And if we compare it to that os Peru, and but read the re-
port of Francisco Lopez and others, it will seem more

other, I thought good to insert part οἱ the 120. chapter of
Lopez in his General History of the Indies, wherein he de-
scribeth the court and magnificence of Guayna Came, an-
cestor to the emperor of Guiana, whose very words are
these :—

y de plata, y cuando menos de plata y cobre, por mas recio.
Tenia en su recamara estatuas huecas de oro, que parescian
gigantes, y las figuras al propio y tamafio de cuantos ani-
males, aves, arboles‚ y yerbas produce la tierra‚ y de cuantos
peces cria la mar y agua de sus reynos. Tenia asimesmo
sogas, costales, cestas, y troxes de oro y plata; rimeros de
palos de oro, que pareciesen lefia rajada para quemar. En
fin no habia cosa en su tierra‚ que no 13 tuviese de oro con-
trahecha; y aun dizen, que tenian los Ingas un verjel en una
