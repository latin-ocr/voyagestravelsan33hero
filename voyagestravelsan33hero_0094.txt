85 HERODOTUS

supposed that not even a god would be able to cause him to
cease from his rule‚ so firmly did he think that it was
established. In that battle then, I say, he was worsted‚ and
being taken alive was brought away to the city of Sais, to
that which had formerly been his own dwelling but from
thenceforth was the palace of Amasis, There for some time
he was kept in the palace‚ and Amasis dealt well with him
but at last, since the Egyptians blamed him, saying that he
acted not rightly in keeping alive him who was the greatest
foe both to themselves and to him, therefore he delivered
Apries over to the Egyptians; and they strangled him, and
after that buried him in the burial-place of his fathers: this
is in the temple of Athene, close to the sanctuary, on the left
hand as you enter. Now the men of Sais buried all those of
this district who had been kings, within the temple; for
the tomb of Amasis also, though it is further from the
sanctuary than that of Apries and his forefathers, yet this
too is within the court of the temple, and it consists of a
colonnade of stone of great size, with pillars carved to imi-

within the colonnade are double doors, and inside the doors
a sepulchral chamber. Also at SaIs there is the burial-place
of him whom I account it not pious to name in connexion
with such a matter, which is in the temple of Athene behind
the house of the goddess, stretching along the whole wall of
it; and in the sacred enclosure stand great obelisks of stone,
and near them is a lake adorned with an edging of stone
and fairly made in a circle, being in size, as it seemed to me,
equal to that which is called the ‘⁶ Round Pool⁹⁹ in Delos.
On this lake they perform by night the show of his suffer-
ings, and this the Egyptians call Mysteries. Of these things
I know more fully in detail how they take place, but I shall
leave this unspoken2 and of the mystic rites of Demeter,
which the Hellenes eall thesmophoria, of these also, although
I know, I shall leave unspoken all except so much as piety
permits me to tell. The daughters of Danaos were they
who brought this rite out of Egypt and taught it to the
women of the Pelasgian53 then afterwards when all the in-
habitants of Peloponnese were driven out by the Dorians,
the rite was lost, and only those who were left behind of the
