EGYPT 59

himself always two or three or even more were slain
when a battle took place (if one may trust at all to the
Epic poets)‚—when‚ I say, things were coming thus to pass,
I consider that even if Priam himself had had Helen as his
wife, he would have given her back to the Achaians, if
at least by so doing he might be freed from the evils
which oppressed him. Nor even was the kingdom coming
to Alexander next, so that when Priam was old the govern-

and more of a man than he, would certainly have received
it after the death of Priam; and him it behoved not to allow
his brother to go on with his wrong-doing, considering that
great evils were coming to pass on his account both to him-

to that one which they call Summer they do reverence and
make offerings, while to the other which is called Winter
they do the opposite of these things. This king, they said,
got great wealth of silver‚ which none of the kings born
after him could surpass or even come near to; and wishing
to store his wealth in safety he caused to be built a chamber
of stone, one of the walls whereof was towards the out-
side of his palace: and the builder of this, having a design
against it, contrived as follows, that is, he disposed one of
the stones in such a manner that it could be taken out
easily from the wall either by two rnen or even by one.
So when the chamber was finished, the king stored his
