352 SIR WALTER RALEIGH

islands overflown twenty foot high above the level of the
ground, saving some few raised grounds in the middle of
them; and for this cause they are enforced to live in this
manner. They never eat of anything that is set or sown;
and as at home they use neither planting nor other manu-
rance‚ so when they come abroad they refuse to feed of
aught but of that which nature without labour bringeth forth.
They use the tops of palmitos for bread, and kill deer, fish,
and porks for the rest of their sustenance. They have also
many sorts of fruits that grow in the woods, and great
variety of birds and t'owls; and if to speak of them were not
tedious and vulgar, surely we saw in those passages of very
rare colours and forms not elsewhere to be found, for as
much as Ι have eithe: seen or read.

Of these people those that dwell upon the branches of
Orenoqueg called Capztri and Macm’eo, are for the most part
carpenters of canoas; for they make the most and fairest
canoas, and 5611 them into Guiana for gold and into Trinidad
for tabacco, in the excessive taking whereof they exceed all
nations. And notwithstanding the moistness of the air in
which they live, the hardness of their diet, and the great
labours they suffer to hunt, fish, and fowl for their living, in
all my life, either in the Indies or in Europe, did Ι never be-
hold a more goodly or better-favoured people or a more
manly. They were wont to make war upon all nations‚ and
especially on the Connibals, so as none durst without a good
strength trade by those rivers; but of late they are at peace
with their neighbours, all holding the Spaniards for a com-
mon enemy. When their commanders die they use great
lamentation; and when they think the flesh of their bodies
is putrified and fallen from their bones, then they take up
the carcase again and hang it in· the cacique’s house that
died, and deck his skull with feathers of all colourS, and
hang all his gold plates about the bones of his arms, thighs,
and legs. Those nations which are called Arwocas, which
dwell on the south of Orenoque, of which place and nation
our Indian pilot was, are dispersed in many other places,
and do use to beat the bones of their lords into powder, and
their wives and friends drink it all in their several sorts of

drinks.
