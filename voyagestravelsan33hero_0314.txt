306 GILBERT'S VOYAGE

land to put in right with the haven. From Falmouth we
went to Dartmouth, and lay there at anchor before the
Range, while the captain went aland to enquire if there had
been any news of the frigate, which, sailing well, might
happily have been before us; also to certify Sir John Gilbert,
brother unto the General‚ of our hard succeSS‚ whom the
captain desired, while his men were yet aboard him, and were
witnesses of all occurrences in that voyage, it might please

yet comforted in the goodness of God, and His undoubted
providence following him in all that voyage, as it doth
always those at other times whosoever have confidence in
Him alone. Yet have we more near feeling and perseverance
of His powerful hand and protection when God doth bring
us together with others into one same peril, in which He
