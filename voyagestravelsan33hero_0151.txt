THIRD VOYAGE 143

whence our Captain sent some of our men to stay the ring-
ing of the alarm bell, which had continued all this while:
but the church being very strongly built and fast shut,
they could not without firing (which our captain forbade)
get into the steeple where the bell rung.

In the meantime, our Captain having taken two or three
Spaniards in their flight, commanded them to shew him
the Governor’s House, where he understood was the ordi-

more gold and jewels than all our four pinnaces could carry:
which we would presently set some in hand to break open,
notwithstanding the Spaniards report the strength of it.

We were no sooner returned to our strength, but there
was a report brought by some of our men that our pin-
naces were in danger to be taken3 and that if we ourselves
got not aboard before day, we should be oppressed with
multitude both of soldiers and towns-people, This report had
