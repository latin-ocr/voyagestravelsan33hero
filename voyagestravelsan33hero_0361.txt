DISCOVERY OF GUIANA 353

After we departed from the port of these Ciawani we
passed up the river with the flood and anchored the ebb,
and in this sort we went onward. The third day that we
entered the river, our galley carne on ground; and stuck so
fast as we thought that even there our discovery had ended,
and that we must have left four-score and ten of our men
to have inhabited‚ like rooks upon trees, with those nations.
But the next morning, after we had cast out all her ballast,
with tugging and hauling to and fro we got her afloat and
went on. At four days’ end we fell into as goodly a river
as ever I beheld, which was called the great Amana, which
ran more directly without windings and turnings than the
other. But soon after the flood of the sea left us; and,
being enforced either by main strength to row against a
violent current, or to return as wise as we went out, we

had then no shift but to persuade the companies that it was ’

but two or three days’ work, and therefore desired thern to

to row, and to spell one the other at the hour’s end. Every
day we passed by goodly branches of rivers, some falling

from the west, others from the east, into Amamu but those Δ

every one shall be named with his rising and descent. When
three days more were overgone, our companies began to
despair, the weather being extreme hot, the river bordered
with very high trees that kept away the air, and the current
against us every day stronger than other. But we ever-
more commanded our pilots to promise an end the next day,
and used it so long as we were driven to assure thern from
four reaches of the river to three, and so to two, and so to
the next reach. But so long we laboured that many days
were spent, and we driven to draw ourselves to harder allow-
ance, our bread even at the last, and no drink at all; and
our men and ourselves so wearied and scorched, and doubtful
witha] whether we should ever perform it or no, the heat
increasing as we drew towards the line; for we were now in
five degrees.

The further we went on, our victua] decreasing and the
air breeding great faintness, we grew weaker and weaker,
when we had most need of strength and ability. For hourly
