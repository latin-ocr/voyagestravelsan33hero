302 GILBERT'S VOYAGE

again rising above the water, as the manner is of whales,
dolphins, tunnies, porpoises, and all other fish: but confi-
dently showing himself above water without hiding: not-
withstanding, we presented ourselves in open view and ges-
ture to amaze him, as all creatures will be commonly at a
sudden gaze and sight of men. Thus he passed along turn-
ing his head to and fro, yawing and gaping wide, with ugly
demonstration of long teeth‚ and glaring eyes; and to b'id
us a far-ewell, coming right against the Hind, he sent forth
a horrible voice, roaring or bellowing as doth a lion, which
spectacle we all beheld so far as we were able to discern the

this doubtless was, to see a lion in the ocean sea, 01· fish in

which time we comforted each other with hope of hard suc-

carry out lights always by night, that we might keep to-
gether, he departed into his frigate, being by no means to
be entreated to tarry in the Hind, which had been more for
his security. Immediately after followed a sharp storm,
which we overpassed for that time, praised be God.

The weather fair, the General came aboard the Hind
again, to make merry together with the captain, master, and
company, which was the last meeting‚ and continued there
from morning until night. During which time there passed
