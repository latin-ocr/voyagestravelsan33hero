356 SIR WALTER RALEIGH

On both sides of this river we passed the most beautiful
country that ever mine eyes beheld; and whereas all that
we had seen before was nothing but woods, prickles,
bushes, and thorns, here we beheld plains of twenty miles
in length, the grass short and green, and in divers parts
groves of trees by themselves, as if they had been by all
the art and labour in the world so made of purpose3 and
still as we rowed, the deer carne down feeding by the
water's side as if they had been used to a keeper's call.
Upon this river there were great store of fowl, and of
many sorts; we saw in it divers sorts of strange fishes,
and of marvellous bigness; but for lagartos³⁷ it exceeded‚
for there were thousands of those ugly serpents; and the
people call it, for the abundance of them, the River of
Lagartos, in their language. I had a negro, a very proper
young fellow, who leaping out of the galley to swim in
the mouth of this river, was in all our sights taken and
devoured with one of those lagartos. In the meanwhile
our companies in the galley thought we had been all lost,
for we promised to return before night; and sent the Lion's
Whelp’s ship’s boat with Captain leiddon to follow us up
the river. But the next day, after we had rowed up and
down some fourseore miles, we returned, and went on our
way up the great river; and when we were even at the
last cast for want of victuals, Captain Gifford being before
the galley and the rest of the boats‚ seeking out some place
to land upon the banks to make fire, espied four canoas
coming down the river; and with no small joy caused
his men to try the uttermost of their strengths‚ and after
a while two of the four gave over and ran themselves
ashore, every man betaking himself to the fastness of the
woods. The two other lesser got away, while he landed
to lay hold on these3 and so turned into some by-creek,
we knew not whither. Those canoas that were taken were
loaden with bread, and were bound for Margarita in the
West Indies, which those Indians, called Arwacas, proposed
to carry thither for exchange; but in the lesser there were
three Spaniards, who having heard of the defeat of their
Governor in Trinidad, and that we purposed to enter Gaiana,

³⁷ Alligators and caymans.
