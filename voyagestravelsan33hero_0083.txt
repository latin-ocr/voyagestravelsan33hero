EGYPT 75

had come into being long before: but as it is, with regard to
Dionysos the Hellenes say that as soon as he was born Zeus
sewed him up in his thigh and carried him to Nysa, which is
above Egypt in the land of Ethiopia; and as to Pan, they
cannot say whither he went after he was born. Hence it
has become clear to me that the Hellenes learnt the names
of these gods later than those of the other godS‚ and trace
their descent as if their birth occurred at the time when they
first learnt their names.

Thus far then the history is told by the Egyptians them-
selves; but Ι will now recount that which other nations also
tell, and the Egyptians in agreement with the others, ot‘ that
which happened in this land: and there will be added to this
also something of that which I have myself seen.

⁵Being set free after the reign of the priest of Hephaistos,
the EgyptianS, since they could not live any time without a
king, set up over them twelve kings, having divided all
Egypt into twelve parts. These made intermarriages with
one another and reigned, making agreement that they would
not put down one another by force, nor seek to get an ad-
vantage over one another, but would live in perfect friend-
ship: and the reason why they made these agreements‚ guard-
ing them very strongly from violation, was this, namely that
an oracle had been given to them at first when they began
to exercise their rule, that he of them who should pour a
libation with a bronze cup in the temple or* Hephaistos,
should be king of all Egypt (for they used to assemble to-
gether in all the temples). Moreover they resolved to join
all together and leave a memorial of themselves; and having
so resolved they caused to be made a labyrinth, situated a
little above the lake of Moiris and nearly opposite to that
which is called the City of Crocodiles. This I saw myseff,
and I found it greater than words can say. For if one
should put together and reckon up all the buildings and all
the great works produced by Hellenes, they would prove to
be inferior in labour and expense to this labyrinth, though it
ιε true that both the temple at Ephesos and that at Samos
are works worthy of note. The pyramids also were greater
than words can say, and each one of them is equal to many
works of the Hellenes, great as they may be; but the laby-
