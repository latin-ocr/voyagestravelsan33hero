DEDICATORY EPISTLE To ELIZABETH 131

Humbly submitting myself to Your gracious censure, both in
writing and presenting; that Posterity be not deprived of such
help as may happily be gained hereby, and out· present Age,
at least, may be satisfied, in the rightfulness of these actions,
which hitherto have been silenced: and Your Servant’s labour not
seem altogether lost, not only in travels by sea and land, but also
in writing the Report thereos (a work to him no less trouble-
some) yet made pleasant and sweet, in that it hath been, is, and

shall be for Your Maiesty’s content3 to whom I have devoted
myself [and] live or die.
