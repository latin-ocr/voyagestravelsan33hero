next, we beat up and down as near unto the wrack as was
possible for us, looking out if by good hap we might espy
any of them.

This was a heavy and grievous event, to lose at one blow
our chief ship freighted with great provision, gathered to-
gether with much travail, care, long time, and difficulty; but
more was the loss of our men, which perished to the number
almost of a hundred souls. Amongst whom was drowned a
learned man, a Hungarian,u born in the city of Euda, called
thereos Budoeus, who, of piety and zeal to good attempts,
adventured in this action, minding to record in the Latin
tongue the gests and things worthy of remembrance, hap-
pening in this discovery, to the honour of our nation, the
same being adorned with the eloquent style of this orator
and rare poet of our time.

Here also perished our Saxon refiner and discoverer of
inestimable riches, as it was left amongst some of us in un-
doubted hope. No less heavy was the loss of the captain,
Maurice Brown, a virtuous, honest, and discreet gentleman,
overseen only in liberty given late before to men that ought
to have been restrained, who showed himself a man resolved,
and never unprepared for death, as by his last act of this
tragedy appeared, by report of thern that escaped this wrack
miraculously, as shall be hereafter declared. For when all
hope was past of recovering the ship, and that men began to
give over, and to save themselves, the captain was advised
before to shift also for his life, by the pinnace at the stern
of the ship; but refusing that eounsel, he would not give
example with the first to leave the ship, but used all means
to exhort his people not to despair, nor so to leave off their
labour, choosing rather to die than to incur infamy by for
saking his charge, which then might be thought to have
perished through his defaust, showing an ill precedent unto
his men, by leaving the ship first himself. With this mind
he mounted upon the highest deck, where he attended im-
minent death, and unavoidable; how long, 1 leave it to God,
who withdraweth not his comfort from his servants at such
times.

In the mean season, certain, to the number of fourteen
