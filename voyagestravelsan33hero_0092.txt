summon him; and he answered him that he had for some
time past been preparing to do so, and that Apries would
have no occasion to find fault with him, for he would both
come himself and bring others with him. Then Patarbemis
both perceiving his intention from that which he said, and
also seeing his preparations, departed in haste, desiring to
make known as quickly as possible to the king the things
which were being done: and when he carne back to Apries
not bringing Amasis, the king paying no regard to that which
he said, but being moved by violent anger, ordered his ears
and his nose to be cut off. And the rest of the Egyptians
who still remained on his side, when they saw the man of
most repnte among them thus suffering shameful outrage,
waited no longer but joined the others in revolt, and
delivered themselves over to Amasis. Then Apries having
heard this also, armed his foreign mercenaries and marched
against the Egyptians: now he had about him Carian and
Ionian mercenaries to the number of thirty thousand; and

city of Momemphis and were about to make trial of one
another in fight.

these one class is called that of the priests, and another that
of the warriors, while the others are the cowherds, swine-

given them from the occupations which they follow. Of
them the warriors are called Calasirians and Hermotybians,
and they are of the following districts‚——for all Egypt is
divided into districts. The districts of the Hermotybians
are those of Busiris, Sais, Chemmis, Papremis, the island
called Prosopitis, and the half of Nath0,——of these districts
are the Hermotybians, who reached when most numerous
the number of sixteen myriads. Of these not one has learnt
anything of handicraft, but they are given up to war entirely.
Again the districts of the Calasirians are those of Thebes,
Bubastis, Aphthis, Tanis, Mendes, Sebennytos, Athribis,
