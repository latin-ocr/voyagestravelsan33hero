RALEIGH’S DISCOVERY OF GUIANA

The DiscovssnY of the large, rich, and beautiful EMPIRE of GuxANA;
with a Relation of the great and golden (In-Y of MANOA, which
the Spaniards call ΕΙ, Domino, and the Pnovmcsss of Emeum,
Axonam, AMAPAIA, and other Countries, with their rivers, adjoin-
ing. Performed in the year 1595 by δικ WALTER RALEIGH,
KNIGHT, enum of her Majesty’s Gustu, Lord Warden of the
STAN'NARiEs, and her Highness' LI'EUTENANT-GENERAL of the
CotiNTY of CORNWALL.

To the Riglzt Honourable my singular good Lord and kinsman
CHARLES HOWARD, Knight of the Garter, Baron, and Coun-⁵
cillor‚ and of the Admirals of ENGLAND the most renownea'; and
to the Right Honourable δικ ROBERT CECIL‚ chnr, Coun-
cillor in her Highness' Privy Coum-ils.

¹ ’ OR your Honours’ many honourable and friendly parts, I
F have hitherto only returned promises 3 and now, for answer

of both your adventures, I have sent you a bundle of pa-
pers, which I have divided between your Lordship and Sir Robert
Cecil, in these two respects chiefly; first, for that it is reason that
wasteful factors, when they have consumed such stocks as they
had in trust, do yield some colour for the same in their account;
secondly, for that Ι am assured that whatsoever shall be done, or
written, by me, shall need a double protection and defence. The
trial that Ι had of both your loves, when Ι was left of all, but of
malice and revenge, makes me still presume that you will be
pleased (knowing what little power Ι had to perform aught‚ and
the great advantage of forewarned enernies) to answer that out
of knowledge, which others shall but object out of malice. In
my more happy times as Ι did especially honour you both, so I
found that your loves sought me out in the darkest shadow of
adversity, and the same affection which accompanied my better
fortune soared not away from me in my many miseries3 all
which though I cannot requite, yet I shall ever acknowledge; and
the great debt which I have no power to pay, I can do no more
