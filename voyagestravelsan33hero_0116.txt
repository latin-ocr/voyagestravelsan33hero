103 TACITUS

as his ability can possibly furnish. When the whole stock
is consumed, he who had treated so hospitably guides and
accompanies his guest to a new scene of hospitality; and
both proceed to the next house, though neither of them
invited. Nor avails it, that they were not: they are there
received, with the same frankness and humanity. Be-
tween a stranger and an acquaintance, in dispensing the
rules and benefits of hospitality, no differ-enee is made.
Upon your departure, if you ask anything‚ it is the custorn
to grant it ; and with the same facility, they ask of you.
In gifts they delight, but neither claim merit from what
' they give, nor own any obligation for what they receive.
Their manner of entertaining their guests is familiar and

‘² kind.

The moment they rise from sleep‚ which they generally
prolong till late in the day, they bathe, most frequently in
warm water3 as in a country where the winter is very
long and severe. From bathing‚ they sit down to meat3
every man apart, upon a particular seat, and at a separate
table. They then proceed to their affairs, all in arms;
as in arms, they no less frequently go to banquet. To con-
tinue drinking night and day without intermission, is a
reproach to no man. Frequent then are their broils, as
usual amongst men intoxicated with liquor; and such broils
rarely terminate in angry words, but for the most part in
maimings and slaughter. Moreover in these their feasts,
they generally deliberate about reconciling parties at
enmsty, about forming affinities, choosing of Princes‚ and
finally about peace and war. For they judge, that at no
season is the soul more open to thoughts that are artless
and upright‚ or more fired with such as are great and bold.
This people, of themselves nowise subtile or politic, from

⁴ the freedom of the place and occasion acquire still more

frankness to disclose the most secret motions and purposes
of their hearts. When therefore the minds of all have been
once laid open and declared, on the day following the several
sentiments are revised and canvassed; and to both con-
jectures of time, due regard is had. They consult, when
they know not how to dissemble; they determine, when they
cannot mistake.
