68 HERODOTUS

and whenever night came on he lighted these and began to
drink and take his pleasure, ceasing neither by day nor by ³
night ; and he went about to the fen-country and to the
woods and wherever he heard there were the most. suitable
places of enjoyment. This he devised (having a mind to
prove that the Oracle spoke falsely) in order that he might
have twelve years of life instead of six, the nights being
turned into days.

This king also left behind him a pyramid, much smaller
than that of his father, of a square shape and measuring on
each side three hundred feet lacking twenty, built moreover
of Ethiopian stone up to half the height. This pyramid
some of the Hellenes say was built by the courtesan Rhod-
opis, not therein speaking rightly: and besides this it is
evident to me that they who speak thus do not even know
who Rhodopis was, for otherwise they would not have
attributed to her the building of a pyramid like this, on
which have been spent (so to speak) innumerable thousands
of talents: moreover they do not know that Rhodopis flour-
ished in the reign of Amasis, and not in this king's reign;
for Rhodopis, lived very many years later than the kings
who left behind them these pyramids. By descent she was
of Thrace, and she was a slave of Iadmon the son of
Hephaistopolis a Samian, and a fellow-slave of Esop the
maker of fables; for he too was once the slave of Iadmon, as
was proved especially by this fact, namely that when the
people of Delphi repeatedly made proclamation in accord-
ance with an oracle‚ to find some one who would take up the
blood-money for the death of Esop, no one else appeared,
but at length the grandson of Iadmon, called Iadmon also,
took it up; and thus it is shown that Esop too was the slave
of Iadmon. As for Rhodopis, she came to Egypt brought
by Xanthes the Samian, and having come thither to exercise
her calling she was redeemed from slavery for a great sum
by a man of Mytilene, Charaxos son of Scamandronymos
and brother of Sappho the lyric poet. Thus was Rhodopis
set free, and she remained in Egypt and by her beauty won
so much liking that she made great gain of money for one
like Rhodopis, though not enough to suffice ἕο] the cost of
such a pyramid as this. In truth there is no need to ascribe
