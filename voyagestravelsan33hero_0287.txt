TO N EWFOUNDLAND 279

pediments unto our further proceeding for that year, and
compel us to winter in those north and cold regions. Where-
fore, suppressing all objections to the contrary, we resolved
to begin our course northward, and to follow, directly as
we might, the trade way unto N ewfoundland; from whence,
after our refreshing and separation of wants, we intended
without delay, by God's permission, to proceed into the
south, not omitting any river or bay which in all that large
tract of land appeared to our view worthy of search. Im-
mediately we agreed upon the manner of our course and
orders to be observed in our voyage; which were delivered
in writing, unto the captains and masters of every ship a
copy, in manner following.

Every ship had delivered two bullets or scrolls‚ the one
sealed up in wax, the other left open; in both which were
included several watehwords. That open, serving upon our
own coast or the coast of Ireland; the other scaled, was
promised on all hands not to be broken up until we should
be clear of the Irish coast; which from thenceforth did
serve until we arrived and met all together in such harbours
of the Newfoundland as were agreed for our rendez-vous.
The said watchwords being requisite to know our consorts
whensoever by night, either by fortune of weather‚ our fleet
dispersed should come together agaim or one should hail
another 3 or if by ill watch and steerage one ship should
chance to fall aboard of another in the dark.

The reason of the bullet sealed was to keep secret that
watehword while we were upon our own coast, lest any of
the company stealing from the fleet might bewray the same;
which known to an enemy, he might board us by night
without mistrust, having our own watehword.

ORDERS agreed upon by the CAPTAINS and MASTERS to be
observed by the fleet of Sir HUMFREY GILBERT.

FIRST, The Admiral to carry his flag by day, and his
light by night.

2. Item, if the Admiral shall shorten his sail by night,
then to shew two lights until he be answered again by every
ship shewing one light for a short time.
