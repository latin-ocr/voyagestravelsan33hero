ROUND THE WORLD 257

Nombre 'de Dios, and so overland to Panama, where we
should have strucken the stroke for the treasure‚ and full
recompense of our tedious travails. And thus at Carthagena
we took our first resolution to return homewards, the form
of which resolution I thought good here to put down under
the principal captains’ hands as follow-eth:—

A RssorunoN of the LANn-Cnmms, what course they think most
expedient to be taken. Given at CARTHAGENA, the 27. of Feb-
ruary, 1585.

WHEREAS it hath pleased the General to demand the opinions
of his captains what course they think most expedient to be now
undertaken, the land-captains being assembled by themselves to-
gether, and having advised hereupon, do in three points deliver4
the same.

THE FIRST, touehing the keeping of the town against the force
of the enemy, either that which is present, or that which may come
out of Spain, is answered thus :—-

‘We hold opinion, that with this troop of men which we have
presently with us in land service, being victualled and munitioned,
we may well keep the town, albeit that of men able to answer present
service we have not above 700. The residue, being some 150 men,
by reason of their hurts and sickness, are altogether unable to stand
us in any stead: wherefore hereupon the sea-captains are likewise
to give their resolution, how they will undertake the safety and
service of the ships upon the arrival of any Spanish fleetss

THE SECOND point we make to be this, whether it be meet to go
presently homeward, or else to continue further trial of our fortune
in undertaking such like enterprises as we have done already, and
thereby to seek after that bountiful mass of treasure for recom- ⁴
pense of our travails‚ which was generally expected at our coming
forth of England: wherein we answerz—

That it is well known how both we and the soldiers are en-
tered into this action as voluntary men, without any impress or gage
from her Maiesty or anybody else. And forasmuch as we have
hitherto discharged the parts of honest men, so that now by the
great blessing and favour of our good God there have been taken
three such notable towns, wherein by the estimation of all men
would have been found some very great treasures, knowing that
Santiago was the chief city of all the islands and traffics thereabouts,
St. Domingo the chief city of Hispaniola‚ and the head government
not only of that island, but also of cuba, and of all the islands about
it, as also of such inhabitations of the firm land, as were next unto
it, and a place that is both magnificently built and entertaineth great
trades of merchandise: and now lastly the city of Carthagena, which
cannot be denied to be one of the chief places of most especial im-
