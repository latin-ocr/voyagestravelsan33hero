TO THE COURTEOUS READER

Homzsr READER,

WITHOUT apology, I desire thee, in this ensuing Discourse, to
observe, with me, the power and justice of the LORD of Hosts,
Who could enable so mean a person to right himself upon so
mighty a Prince3 together with the goodness and providence of
GOD very observable in that it pleased Him to raise this man,
not only from a low condition, but even from the state of perse-
cution. His father suffered in it, being forced to fly from his
house, near South Tavistock in Devon, into Kent: and there to
inhabit in the hull of a ship, wherein many of his younger sons
were born. He had twelve in all: and as it pleased GOD to
give most of them a being upon the water, so the greatest part
of them died at sea. The youngest, who though he was [went]
as far as any, yet died at home; whose posterity inherits that,
which by himself and this noble Gentleman the eldest brother,
was hardly, yet worthily gotten.

I could more largely acquaint thee, that this Voyage was his
Third he made into the West Indies; after that [of] his excellent
service, both by sea and land, in Ireland‚ under WALTER, Earl
of EssEX; his next, about the World; another, wherein he took
St. Jago, Cartagena‚ St. Domingo, St. Augustino; his doings
at Cadiz3 besides the first Carrack taught by him to sail into
England; his stirrings in Eighty—seven; his remarkable actions
in Eighty-eight3 his endeavours in the Portugal employment3
his last enterprise, determined by death; and his filling Plymouth
with a plentiful stream of fresh water: but I pass by all these.
I had rather thou shouldest inquire of others! then to seem
myself a vainglorious man.

I intend not his praise! I strive only to set out the praise
of his and our good GOD! that guided him in his truth! and
protected him in his courses! My ends are to stir thee up to
the worship of GOD, and service of our King and Country‚ by
his example! If anything be worth thy consideration; conclude
with me, that the LORD only, can do great things!
