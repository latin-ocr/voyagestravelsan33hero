EGYPT 17

out the whole of Europe Ι suppose that he would do to the
Ister that which he now works upon the Nile. As to the
breeze, why none blows from the river, my opinion is that
from very hot places it is not natural that anything should
blow, and that a breeze is wont to blow from something cold.
Let these matters then be as they are and as they were
at the first: but as to the sources of the Nile, not one either
of the Egyptians or of the Libyans or of the Hellenes, who
came to speech with me, professed to know anything, except ,
the scribe os the sacred treasury of Athene at the city of
Sais in Egypt. To me however this man seemed not to
be speaking seriously when he said that he had certain
knowledge of it; and he said as follows, namely that there
were two mountains of which the tops ran up to a sharp
point, situated between the city of Syene, which is in the
district of Thebes, and Elephantine, and the names of the
mountains were, of the one Crophi and of the other Mophi.
From the middle between these mountains flowed (he said)
the sources of the Nile, which were fathomless in depth,
and half of the water fiowed to Egypt and towards the
North Wind, the other half to Ethiopia and the South Wind,
As for the fathomless depth of the source, he said that
Psammetichos king of Egypt carne to a trial of this matter;
for he had a rope twisted of many thousand fathoms and let
it down in this place, and it found no bottom. By this the
scribe (if this which he told was really as he said) gave me
to understand that there were certain strong eddies there
and a backward flow, and that since the water dashed
against the mountains‚ therefore the sounding-line could
not come to any bottom when it was let down. From no
other person was Ι able to learn anything about this matter;
but for the rest Ι learnt so much as here follows by the most
diligent inquiry; for I went myself as an eye-witness as
far as the city of Elephantine and from that point onwards
I gathered knowledge by report. From the city of Elephan-
tine as one goes up the river there is country which slopes
steeply; so that here one must attach ropes to the vessel
on both sides, as one fastens an ox, and so make one's
way onward; and if the rope break, the vessel is gone at
once, carried away by the violence of the stream. Through
