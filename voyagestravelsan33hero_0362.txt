354 SI R WALTER RALEIGH

the river ran more violently than other against us, and the
barge, wherries, and ship's boat of Captain Gifford and Cap-
tain Caulfield had spent all their provisions; so as we were
brought into despair and discomfort‚ had we not persuaded
all the company that it was but only one day’s work more to
attain the land where we should be relieved of all we wanted,
and if we returned, that we were sure to starve by the way,
and that the world would also laugh us to seorn. On the
banks of these rivers were divers Sorts of fruits good to eat,
flowers and trees of such variety as were sufficient to make
ten volumes of Herbals; we relieved ourselves many times
with the fruits of the country, and sometimes with fowl and
fish. WVe saw birds of all colours‚ some carnation, some
crimson‚ orange-tawny‚ purple, watchet,³⁶ and of all other
sorts, both simple and mixed, and it was unto us a great
good-passing of the time to behold them, besides the relief

and wherries, and leave the galley at anchor the while in the
great river, he would bring us to a town of the Arwacas,
where we should find store of bread, hens, fish, and of the
country wine; and persuaded us, that departing from the
galley at noon we might return yere night. I was very glad
to hear this speech, and presently took my barge, with eight
musketeers‚ Captain Gifford's wherry‚ with himself and four
musketeers, and Captain Caulfield with his wherry‚ and as
many; and so we entered the mouth of this river; and be-
cause we were persuaded that it was so near, we took no
victual with us at all. When we had rowed three hours,
we marvelled we saw no sign of any dwessing, and asked
the pilot where the town was; he told us, a little further.
After three hours more, the sun being almost set, we
began to suspect that he led us that way to betray us;
for he confessed that those Spaniards which fied from
