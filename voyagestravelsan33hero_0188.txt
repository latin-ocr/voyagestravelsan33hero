180 SIR FRANCIS DRAKE

slept; and being but one, they fell upon him, stopped his
mouth from crying, put out his match, and bound him so,
that they well near strangled him by that time he was
brought unto us,

By examining him, we found all that to be true, which our
spy had reported to us, and that he was a soldier entertained
with others by the Treasurer, for guard and conduct of this
treasure‚ from Venta Cruz to Nombre de Dios.

This soldier having learned who our Captain waS, took
courage‚ and was bold to make two requests unto him. The
one that “He would command his Cimaroons which hated
the Spaniards, especially the soldiers extremely, to spare his
life; which he doubted not but they would do at his charge.”
The other was, that “seeing he was a soldier, and assured
him, that they should have that night more gold, besides
jewels, and pearls of great price, then all they could carry
(if not, then he was to be dealt with how they would) ; but if
they all found it so, then it might please our Captain to give
unto him, as much as might suffice for him and his mistress
to live upon, as he had heard our Captain had done to divers
others: for which he would make his name as famous as
any of them which had received like favour.''

Being at the place appointed, our Captain with half his
men [8 English and 15 Cimaroons], lay on one side of the
way, about fifty paces off in the long grass; JOHN OXNAM
with the Captain of the Cimaroons, and the other half, lay
on the other side of the way, at the like distance: but so far
behind, that as occasion served, the former company might
take the foremost mules by the heads, and the hindmost
because the mules tied together, are always driven one after
another; and especially that if we should have need to use
our weapons that night, we might be sure not to endamage
our fellows. We had not lain thus in ambush much above
an hour, but we heard the Recuas coming both from the
city to Venta Cruz, and from Venta Cruz >to the city, which
hath a very common and great trade, when the fleets are
there. W'e heard them by reason they delight much to have
deep-sounding bells, which, in a still night, are heard very
far off.

Now though there were as great charge given as might be,
