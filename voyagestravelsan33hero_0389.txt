DISCOVERY OF GUIANA 381

such merchandises as Ι left with them, thereby to learn the
place, and if it were· possible, to go on to the great city of
Manoa. Which being done, we weighed anchor and coasted
the river on Guiana side, because we came upon the north
side, by the lawns of the Saima and Wikiri.

There carne with us from Aromaia a cecique called
Putijma‚ that commanded the province of Warapana, which
Putijma slew the nine Spaniards upon Caroli before spoken
of; who desired us to rest in the port of his country, promis-
ing to bring us unto a mountain adjoining to his town that
had stones of the colour of gold, which he performed. And
after we had rested there one night Ι went myself in the
morning with most of the gentlemen of my company over-
land towards the said mountain, marching by a river’s side
called Mona, leaving on the right hand a town called Tute-
ritona, standing in the province of Tarracoa, of which
Wariaaremagoto is principal. Beyond it lieth another town
towards the south, in the valley of Amariocapana, which

From the river of Mona we crossed another river in the
said beautiful valley called Giano, and rested ourselves by
a clear lake which lay in the middle of the said Oiana‚· and
one of our guides kindling us fire with two sticks, we stayed
awhile to dry our shirts, which with the heat hung very wet
and heavy on our shoulders. Afterwards we sought the
ford to pass over towards the mountain called I conuri, where
Putijma foretold us of the mine. In this lake we saw one
of the great fishes, as big as a wine pipe‚ which they call
manati, being most excellent and wholesome meat. But
after Ι perceived that to pass the 'said river would require
half—a-day's march more, Ι was not able myself to endure
it, and therefore 1 sent Captain Keymis with six shot to go
on, and gave him order not to return to the port of Putijma,
which is called Chiparepare, but to take leisure, and to
