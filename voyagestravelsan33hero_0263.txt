ROUND THE WORLD 255

met-ly given, the same being the sea-wash shore, where the
water was somewhat fallen, so as most of all their shot was
in vain. Our Lieutenant-General commanded our shot to
forbear shooting until we were come to the wall-side. And
so with pikes roundly together we approached the place,
where we soon found out the barricados of pipes or butts to
be the meetest place for our assault; which, notwithstanding
it was well furnished with pikes and shots, was without stay-
ing attempted by us. Down went the butts of earth, and
pell—mell came our swords and pikes together, after our
shot had first given their volley, even at the enemy's nose.
Our pikes were somewhat longer than theirs, and our bodies
better armed; for very few of them were armed. With
which advantage our swords and pikes grew too hard for

any work done; at the entering whereof was some little
resistance, but soon overcome it was, with few slain or hurt.
They had joined with them many Indians, whom they had
placed in corners of advantage, all bowmen, with their
arrows most villainously empoisoned, so as if they did but
break the skin, the party so touched died without great mar-
vel. Some they slew of our people with their arrows; some
they likewise mischiefed to death with certain pricks of small
sticks sharply pointed, of a foot and a-half long, the one
end put into the ground, the other empoisoned‚ sticking fast
up, right against our coming in the way as we should ap-
proach from our landing towards the town, whereof the-y
had planted a wonderful number in the ordinary way3 but
