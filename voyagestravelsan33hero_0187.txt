THIRD VOYAGE 179

leagues, ever by night; because the country is all champi0n‚
and consequently by day very hot. But from Venta Cruz to
Nombre de Dios as oft as they travel by land with their
treasure, they travel always by day and not by night, be·
cause all that way is full of woods‚ and therefore very fresh
and cool; unless the Cimaroons happily encounter them, and
made them sweat with sear, as sometimes they have done:
whereupon they are glad to guard their Recoes [i.e., Recuas,
the Spanish word for a drove of beasts of burdam· meaning
here, a mule tram] with soldiers as they pass that way.

This last day, our Captain did behold and view the most

hath need.

Upon this notice, we forthwith marcfied four leagues, till
we came within two leagues of Venta Cruz, in which march
two of our Cimaroons which were sent before, by scent of
his match, found and brought a Spaniard, whom they had
found asleep by the way, by scent of the said match, and
drawing near thereby‚ heard him taking his breath as he
