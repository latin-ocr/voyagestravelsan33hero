DISCOVERY OF GUIANA 337

from thence, his ship riding in Falmouth the same year that
my ships came first from Virginia; there was another this
year in Helford, that also came from thence, and had been
fourteen months at an anchor in Amazons; which were both
very rich.

Although, as Ι arn persuaded, Gaiana cannot be entered
that way, yet no doubt the trade of gold from thence
passeth by branches of rivers into the river of Amazons, and
so it doth on every hand far from the country itself3 for
those Indians of Trinidad have plates of gold from Guiana,
and those cannibals of Dominica which dwell in the islands
by which our ships pass yearly to the West Jndies, also the
Indians of Paria, those Indians called Tucaris, Clzochi, Apo-
tomios, Cumanagotos, and all those other nations inhabiting
near about the mountains that run {rom Paria thorough the
province of Venezuela, and in Maracapana, and the canni-
bals of Guanipa, the Indians called Assawai, Coaca, Asai,
and the rest (all which shall be described in my description
as they are situate) have plates of gold of Gaiana. And
upon the river of Amasons, Thevet writeth that the people
wear croissants of gold, t'or of that form the Guianians most
commonly make them; so as from Dominica to Amazons,
which is above 250 leagues, all the chief Indians in all parts
wear of those plates of Guiana. Undoubtedly those that
trade [with] Amazons return much gold, which (as is afore-
said) cometh by trade from Guiana, by some branch of a
river that falleth from the country into Amazons, and either
it is by the river which passeth by the nations called Tis-
na-dos, or by Caripmta.

I made enquiry amongst the most ancient and best travelled
of the Orenoqueponi, and I had knowledge of all the rivers
between Ore-noque and Amazons, and was very desirous to
understand the truth of those warlike women, because of
some it is believed, of others not. And though I digress
from my purpose, yet I will set down that which hath been
delivered me for truth of those women, and Ι spake with a
meique, or lord of people, that told me he had been in the
river, and beyond it also. The nations of these women are
on the south side of the river in the provinces of Topago,
and their chiefest strengths and retracts are in the islands
