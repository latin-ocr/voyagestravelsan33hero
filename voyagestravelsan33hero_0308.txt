barge, which was made in the Newfoundland, cut off the
rope wherewith it was towed, and committed themselves to
God's mercy, amidst the storm, and rage of sea and winds,
destitute of food, not so much as a drop of fresh water. The
boat seeming overcharged in foul weather with company,

For those that arrived upon the N ewfoundland were brought

After this heavy chance, we continued in beating the sea
up and down, expecting when the weather would clear up
that we might yet bear in with the land, which we judged
not far off either the continent or some island. For we
many times, and in sundry places found ground at 50, 45, 40
fathoms, and less. The ground coming upon our lead, being
sometime oozy sand and other while a broad shell, with a
little sand about it.

Our people lost courage daily after this ill success, the
weather continuing thick and blustering, with increase of
cold, winter drawing on, which took from them all hope of
