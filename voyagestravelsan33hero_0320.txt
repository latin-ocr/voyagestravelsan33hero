312 SIR WALTER RALEIGH

for a time but confess to be due. It is true that as my errors
were great, so they have yielded very grievous effects; and if
aught might have been deserved in former times, to have coun-
terpoised any part of offences, the fruit thereos, as it seemeth,
was long before fallen from the tree, and the dead stock only
remained. Ι did therefore, even in the winter of my life, under-
take these travails, fitter for bodies less blasted with missortunes,
for men of greater ability, and for minds of better encouragement,
that thereby, if it were possible, I might recover but the modera-
tion of excess, and the least taste of the greatest plenty formerly
possessed. If Ι had known other way to win‚ if Ι had imagined
how greater adventures might have regained, if Ι could conceive
what farther means I might yet use but even to appease so pow-
erful displeasure‚ I would not doubt but for one year more to hold
fast my soul in my teeth till it were performed. Of that little
remain I had, I have wasted in effect all herein. Ι have under-
gone many constructions; Ι have been accompanied with many
sorrows, with labem, hunger, heat, sickness, and peril; it ap-
peareffl, notwithstanding, that I made no other bravado of going
to the sea, than was meant, and that I was never hidden in C orn-
wall, or elsewhere, as was supposed. They have grossly belied
me that forejudged that I would rather become a servant to the
Spanish king than return3 and the rest were much mistaken‚
who would have persuaded that Ι was too easeful and sensual
to undertake a Journey of so great travail. But if what I have
done receive the gracious construction of a painful pilgrimage,
and purchase the least remission‚ I shall think all too little, and
that there were wanting to the rest many miseries. But if both
the times past, the present, and what may be in the future, do
all by one grain of gall continue in eternal distaste‚ I do not
then know whether I should bewail myself, either for my too
much travail and expense, or condemn myself for doing less than
that which can deserve nothing. From myself Ι have deserved
no thanks, for I am returned a beggar, and withered; but that
Ι might have bettered my poor estate, it shall appear from the
following discourse, if Ι had not only respected her Maiesty's
future honour and riches.

It became not the former fortune, in which I once lived, to go
journeys of picory;1 it had sorted ill with the offices of honour.
