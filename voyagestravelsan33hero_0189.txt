THIRD VOYAGE 181

that none of our men should shew or stir themselves, but
let all that camo from Venta Cruz to pass quietly ; yea, their
Recuas also, because we knew that they brought nothing but
merchandise from thence: yet one of our men, called
ROBERT ΡΙΚΕ, having drunken too much aqua vitoe without
water, forgot himself, and entieing a Cimaroon forth with
him was gone hard to the way, with intent to have shown
his forwardness on the foremost mules. And when a
cavalier from Venta Cruz, well mounted, with his page run-
ning at his stin-up, passed by, unadvisedly he rose up to see
what he was: but the Cimaroon of better discretion pulled
him down, and lay upon him, that he might not discover
them any more. Yet by this, the gentleman had taken notice
by seeing one half all in white: for that we¹ had all put our

afterwards learnt by the other Recuas) making report to
him, what he had seen presently that night, what he heard
of Captain DRAKE this long time, and what he conjectured
to be most likely: viz„ that the said Captain DRAmz, or some
for him, disappointed of his expectation, of getting any
great treasure, both at Nombre de Dios and other places,
was by some means or other come by land, in covert through
the woodS, unto this place, to speed of his purpose: and
thereupon persuaded him to turn his Recua out of the way,
and let the other Recuas which were coming after to pass
on. They were whole Recuas, and loaded but with victuals
