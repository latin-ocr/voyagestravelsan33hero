144 SIR FRANCIS DRAKE

“whether they were Captain DRAKE’s ?'' And upon
answer received, continued entreating to be taken aboard,
though he had first three or four shot made at him, until at
length they fetched him; and learned by him, that, not past
eight days before our arrival, the King had sent thither
some 150 soldiers to guard the town against the Cimaroons,
and the town at this time was full of people beside: which
all the rather believed, because it agreed with the report
of the Negroes, which we took before at the Isle of Pinos.
And therefore our Captain sent his brother and JoHN
OXNAM to understand the truth thereof.

They found our men which we left in our pinnaces much
frightened, by reason that they saw great troops and com-
panies running up and down, with matches lighted, some
with other weapons, crying Que gente? que gente? which
not having been at the first conflict, but coming from the
utter ends of the town (being at least as big as Plymouth)‚
came many times near us; and understanding that we were
English, discharged their pieces and ran away.

Presently after this, a mighty shower of rain, with a
terrible storm of thunder and lightning, fell, which poured
down so vehemently (as it usually doth in those countries)
that before we could recover the shelter of a certain shade
or penthouse at the western end of the King’s Treasure
House, (which seemeth to have been built there of pur-
pose to avoid sun and rain) some of our bow—strings were
wet, and some of our match and powder hurt ! which while
we were careful of, to refurnish and supply; divers of
our men harping on the reports lately brought uS, were
muttering of the forces of the town, which our Captain
perceiving, told them, that “He had brought them to the
mouth of the Treasure of the World, if they would want
it, they might henceforth blame nobody but themselves! ’'

And therefore as soon as the storm began to assuage of
his fury (which was a long half hour) willing to give his
men no longer leisure to demur of those doubts, nor yet
allow the enemy farther respite to gather themselves to-
gether, he stept forward commanding his brother, with
JOHN OXNAM and the company appointed them, to break
the King's Treasure House: the rest to follow him to keep
