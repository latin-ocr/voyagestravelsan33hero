EGYPT 39

to them very rarely, at intervals, as the people of Heliopolis
say, of five hundred years; and these say that he comes
regularly when his father dies ; and if he be like the painting,
he is of this size and nature, that is to say, some of his
feathers are of gold colour and others red, and in outline
and size he is as nearly as possible like an eagle. This bird
they say (but I cannot believe the story) contrives as fol-

were many in number. This region in which the spines are
seattered upon the ground is of the nature of an entrance
from a narrow mountain pass to a great plain, which plain
adjoins the plain of Egypt; and the story goes that at the
beginning of spring winged serpents from Arabia fly towards
Egypt, and the birds called ibises meet them at the entrance
to this country and do not suffer the serpents to go by but
kill thern. On account of this deed it is (say the Arabians)
that the ibis has come to be greatly honoured by the
