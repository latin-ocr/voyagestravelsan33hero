308 GILBERT'S VOYAGE

was not fit, presuming the cause pretended on God's behalf
would carry him to the desired end. Into which having
thus made re-entry, he could not yield again to withdraw,
though he saw no encouragement to proceed; lest his credit,
foiled in his first attempt, in a second should utterly be dis-
graced. Between extremities he made a right adventure,
putting all to God and good fortune; and, which was worst,
refused not to entertain every person and means whatso-
ever, to furnish out this expedition, the success whereof
hath been declared.

But such is the infinite bounty of God, who from every
evil deriveth good. For besides that fruit may grow in
time of our travelling into those north-west lands, the
crosseS, turmoils‚ and affiictions, both in the preparation and
execution of this voyage, did correct the intemperate
humours which before we noted to be in this gentleman,
and made unsavoury and less delightful his other manifold
virtues. Then as he was refined, and made nearer drawing
unto the image of God, so it pleased the Divine will to re-
sume him unto Himself‚ whither both his and every other
high and noble mind have always aspired.
