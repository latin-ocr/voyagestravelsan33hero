EGYPT 19

Persians liave outposts. The Egyptians then of whom I
speak had served as outposts for three years and no one
relieved them from their guard ; accordingly they took
counsel together, and adopting a common plan they all
in a body revolted from Psammetichos and set out for
Ethiopia. Hearing this Psammetichos set forth in pur-

and when the Nasamonians carne and were asked by him
whether they were able to tell him anything more than he
