214 DRAKE'S FAMOUS VOYAGE'

The two and twentieth day our General went ashore to the
main, and in his company John Thomas, and Robert
W interme, Oliver the master-gunner, J ohh Breww, Thomas
Hood, and Thomas Drake. And entering on land, they
presently met with two or three of the country people. And
Robert Winterhie having in his hands a bow and arrows,
went about to make a shoot of pleasure, and, in his draught‚
his bowstring brake; which the rude savages taking as a
token of war, began to bend the force of their bows against

being throughly heard, and all things done in good order as
near as might be to the course of our laws in England, it
was concluded that Master Doughty should receive punish-
ment according to the quality of the offence. And he, seeing
no remedy but patience for himself, desired before his death
to receive the communion, which he did at the hands of
Master Fletcher, our minister, and our General himself ac-
companied him in that holy action. Which being done, and
the place of execution made ready, he having embraced our
General, and taken his leave of all the company, with
” prayers for the Queen’s Majesty and our realm, in quiet
sort laid his head to the block‚ where he ended his life. This
being done, our General made divers speeches to the whole
company, persuading us to unity‚ obedience‚ love, and re-
gard of our voyage, and for the better confirmation thereos,
