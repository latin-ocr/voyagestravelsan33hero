250 DRAKE’S FAMOUS VOYAGE

had the guard of the cassse, hearing us busy about the gates
of the said cassse, abandoned the same; some being taken
prisoners, and some fleeing away by the help of boats to the
other side of the haven, and so into the country.

The next day we quartered a little more at large, but
not into the half part of the town; and so making substantial
trenches, and planting all the ordnance, that each part was cor-
respondent to other, we held this town the space of one month.

In the which time happened some accidentS, more than
are well remembered for the present. But amongst other
things, it chanced that the Genera] sent on his message to
the Spaniards a negro boy with a flag of white, signifying
truce, as is the Spanish ordinary manner to do there, when
they approach to speak to us; which boy unhappily was
first met withal by some of those who had been belonging
as officers for the king in the Spanish galley, which with the
town was lately fallen into our hands. Who, without all
order or reason, and contrary to that good usage wherewith
we had entertained their messengers, furiously struck the
poor boy through the body with one of their horsemen's
staves; with which wound the boy returned to the General,
and after he had declared the manner of this wrongful
cruesty, died forthwith in his presence. Wherewith the
General being greatly passioned, commanded the provost-
marshal to cause a couple of friars, then prisoners‚ to be
carried to the same place where the boy was strucken‚ ac-
companied with sufficient guard of our soldiers‚ and there
presently to be hanged‚ despatching at the same instant an-
other poor prisoner, with this reason wherefore this execu-
tion was done, and with this message further, that until
the party who had thus murdered the General’s messenger
were delivered into our hands to receive condign punish-
ment, there should no day pass wherein there should not two
prisoners be hanged, until they were all consumed which were
in our hands. Whereupon the day following, he that had
been captain of the king's galley brought the offender to
the town's end, offering to deliver him into our hands. But
it was thought to be a more honourable revenge to make
them there, in our sight, to perform the execution them-
selves 3 which was done accordingly.
