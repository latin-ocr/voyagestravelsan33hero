THIRD VOYAGE 203

12 tons, but the most of 30 or 40 tons, which all had inter-
course between Cartagena and Nornbre de Dios. The most
of which, during our abode in those parts we took; and
some of them, twice or thrice each: yet never burnt nor
sunk any, unless they were made out Men-of-war against
us, or laid as stales to entrap us.

And of all the men taken in these several vessels, we never
offered any kind of violence to any, after they were once
come under our power; but either presently dismissed them in
safety, or keeping them with us some longer time (as some
of them we did), we always provided for their sustenance
as for ourselves, and secured them from the rage of the
Cimaroons against them: till at last, the danger of their
discovering where our ships lay being over past, for which
only cause we kept them prisoners, we set them also free.

Many strange birds, beasts‚ ancl fishes, besides fruits,
trees, plants, and the like, were seen and observed of us
in this Journey, which willingly we pretermit as hastening
to the end of our voyage: which from this Cape of St.
Antonio, we intended to finish by sailing the directest and
speediest way homeward; and accordingly, even beyond our
own expectation, most happily performed.

For whereas our Captain had purposed to touch at New-
foundland‚ and there to have watered; which would have
been some let unto us, though we stood in great want of
water; yet GOD Almighty so provided for us, by giving
us good store of rain water, that we were sufficiently fur-
nished: and, within twenty-three days, we passed from the
Cape of Florida, to the Isles of Scilly, and so arrived at
Plymouth, on Sunday, about sermon time, August the

9 At &gat time, the news of our Captain’s return brought
unto his, did so speedily pass over all the church, and sur-
pass their minds with desire and delight to see him, that
very few or none remained with the Preacher. All hastened
to see the evidence of GOD’s love and blessing towards our
Gracious Queen and country, by the fruit of our Captain's
labour and success,
