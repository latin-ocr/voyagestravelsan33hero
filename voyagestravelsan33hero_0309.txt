TO NEWFOUNDLAND 301

amendment, settling an assurance of worse weather to grow
upon us every day. The leeside of us lay full of flats and
dangers, inevitable if the wind blew hard at south. Some
again doubted we were ingulfed in the Bay of S t. Lawrence,
the coast full of dangers‚ and unto us unknown. But above
all, provision waxed scant, and hope of supply was gone
with loss of our Admiral. Those in the frigate were already
pinched with spare allowance, and want of clothes chiefly:
whereupon they besought the General to return to England,

changed our course, and returned back for England. At
which very instant, even in winding about, there passed
along between us and towards the land which we now for-
sook a very lion to our seeming‚ in shape, hair, and colour,
not swimming after the manner of a beast by moving of his
