THIRD VOYAGE 165

rode therein four days, feeling great cold, by reason we had
such sore rains with westerly wind, and so little succour in
our pinnaces.

The fifth day (27th October) there came in a {rigate from
the sea, which seeing us make towards her, ran herself
ashore‚ unhanging her rudder and taking away her saiIs,
that she might not easily be carried away. But when we
were come up to her, we perceived about a hundred horse
and foot‚ with their furniture, come down to the point of
the Main, where we interchanged some shot with thern. One
of our great shot passed so near a brave cavalier of theirs,
that thereby they were occasioned to advise themselves, and
retreat into the woods: where they might sufficiently defend
and rescue the frigate from us, and annoy us also, if we
stayed long about her.

Therefore we concluded to go to sea again, putting forth
through Boca Chica, with intent to take down our masts,
upon hope of fair weather‚ and to ride under the rocks called
Las Serenas, which are two leagues off at sea, as we had
usually done aforetirne, so that they could not discern us
from the rocks. But, there, the sea was mightily grown,
that we were forced to take the harbour again; where we
remained six days, notwithstanding the Spaniards grieved
greatly at our abode there so long.

They put (2nd November) another device in practice to
endanger us,

For they sent forth a great shassop, a fine gundeIoe, and
a great canoe‚ with certain Spaniards with shot, and many
Indians with poisoned arrows, as it seemed, with intent to
begin some fight, and then to fly. For as soon as we rowed
toward them and interchanged shot, they presently retired
and went ashore into the woods, where an ambush of some
sixty shot were laid for us: besides two pinnaces and a
frigate warping towards us, which were manned as the rest.
They attempted us very boldly, being assisted by those
others, which from out of the wood, had gotten aboard the
gundeloe and canoe, and seeing us bearing from them (which
we did in respect of the ambuscado), they encouraged them-
selves and assured their fellows of the day.

But our Captain weighing this their attempt, and being
