INTRODUCTORY NOTE

HERODOTUS was born at Halicarnassus, on the southwest coast
of Asia Minor, toward the end of the fifth century, B. C. Of his
life we know almost nothing, except that he spent much of it
traveliny, to collect the material for his writinys, and that he
finally settled down at Thurii, in southern Italy, where his great
work was composed. He died in 424 Β. C.

The subject of the history of Herodotus is the struyyle between
the Greeks and the barbariam, which he brings down to the battle
of Mycale in 479 Β, C. The work, as we have it, is divided into
nine books, named after the nine Muses, but this division is prob-
ably due to the Alexandrine yrammarians. His information he
yathered mainly from oral sources, as he traveled throuyh Asia
Minor, down into Egypt, round the Black Sea, and into various
parts of Greece and the neighboriny countries. The chronoloyical
narrative lzalts from time to time to yive opportunity for descrip-
tions of the country, the people‚ and their customs and previous
history; and the political account is constantly varied by rare
tales and wonders.

Among] these descriptions of countries the most fascinatiny to
the modern, as it was to the ancient, reader is his account of the
marvels of the land of Eyypt. From the priests at Memphis,
Heliopolis, and the Egyptian Thebes he learned what he reports
of the siee of the country, the wonders of the Nile, the cere-
monies of their reliyion, the sacredness of their animals, He
tells also of the stranye ways of the crocodile and of that mar-
velous bird, the Phenix‚· of dress and funerals and embalrniny;
of the eatiny of lotos and papyrum of the pyramids and the
yreat labyrinth; of their kinys and queens and courtesans.

Yet Herodotus is not a mere teller of strange tales. However
credulous he may appear to a modern judynient, he takes care
to keep separate what he knows by his own observation from
what he has merely inferred and from what he has been told. He is
candid about acknowledyiny ignorance‚ and when versions differ
he yives both. Thus the modern scientific historiam with other
means of corroboration, can sometimes learn from Herodotus
more than Herodotus himself knew.

There is abundant evidence, too, that Herodotus had a phi*
