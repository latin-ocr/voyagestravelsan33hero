hundred years the kings who arose before Amyrtaios were
not able to find it. Now the name of this island is Elbo,
and its size is ten furlongs each way.

After him there came to the throne the priest of He-
phaistos, whose name was Sethos. This man, they said, neg-
lected and held in no regard the warrior class of the Egyp-

So far in the story the Egyptians and the priests were they
