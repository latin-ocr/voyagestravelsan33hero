298 GILBERT’S VOYAGE

could recover only that one. These also, passing through the
ocean in herds, did portend storm. Ι omit to recite frivolous
reports by them in the frigate, of strange voices the same
night, which scared some from the helm.

Thursday‚ the 29. of August, the wind rose, and blew
vehemently at south and by east, bringing withal rain and
thick mist, so that we could not see a cable length before us;
and betimes in the morning we were altogether run and
folded in amongst flats and sands, amongst which we
found shoal and deep in every three or four ships’ length,
after we began to sound: but first we were upon them un·
awares, until Master Cox looking out, discerned, in his
judgment, white cliffs, crying Lami! withal; though we
could not after-ward descry any land, it being very likely the
breaking of the sea white, which seemed to be white cliffs,

Immediately tokens were given unto the Delight, to cast

In this distress, we had vigilant eye unto the Admiral,
whom we saw cast away, without power to give the men
succour, neither could we espy any of the men that leaped
overboard to save themselves, either in the same pinnace, or
cock, or upon rasters, and such like means presenting them-
selves to men in those extremities, for we desired to save
the men by every possible means. But all in vain, sith God
