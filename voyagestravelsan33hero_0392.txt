384 SIR WALTER RALEIGH

no other till this day but entertain the Spaniards, his country
lying so directly in their way, and next of all other to any
entrance that should be made in Guiona on that side. And
they further assured us, that it was not for sear of our
coming that he was removed, but to be acquitted of the
Spaniards or any other that should come hereafter. For
the province of Cairoma is situate at the mountain foot,
which divideth the plains of Gaiana from the countries of
the Orenoqueponi; by means whereof if any should come
in our absence into his towns, he would slip over the moun—
tains into the plains of Gaiana among the Epuremei, where
the Spaniards durst not follow him without great force.
But in mine opinion, or rather I assure myseff, that Cara·
pana being a notable wise and subtle fellow, a man of one
hundred years of age and therefore of great experIence, is
removed to look on, and if he find that we return strong he

Spaniards, and say it was for sear of our coming.

We therefore thought it bootless to row so far down the
stream, or to seek any farther of this old fox; and therefore

Iparoma. Below those four are also these branches and
mouths of Orenoque, which fall into the east sea, whereof
the first is Araturi‚ the next Amat-ura, the third Barima,
the fourth Wana, the fifth M orooca, the sixth Paroma, the
last Wijmz'. Beyond them there fall out of the land between
Orenoque and Amazons fourteen rivers, which I forbear to
name, inhabited by the Arwacas and Cannibals.

It is now time to return towards the north, and we found
it a wearisome way back from the borders of Emeria, to
recover up again to the head of the river Carerupana, by
which we descended, and where we parted from the galley,
which I directed to take the next way to the port of
Toparimaca, by which we entered first.

All the night it was stormy and dark‚ and full of thunder
and great showers‚ so as we were driven to keep close by
the banks in our small boats, being all heartily afraid both of
