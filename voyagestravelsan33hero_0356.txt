348 SIR WALTER RALEIGH

the Lion's Whelp, with his ship—boat, to try another branch
of the river in the bottom of the Bay of Guanipa, which was
called Amana, to prove if there were water to be found for
either of the small ships to enter. But when he came to
the mouth of Amana, he found it as the rest, but stayed not
to discover it thoroughly, because he was assured by an
Indian‚ his guide, that the cannibals of Guanipa would assail
thern with many canoas, and that they shot poisoned arrows;
so as if he hasted not back, they should all be lost.

In the meantime, fearing the worst, Ι caused all the car-
penters we had to cut down a galego boat, which we meant
to cast off, and to fit her with banks to row on, and in all
things to prepare her the best they could, so as she might
be brought to draw but five foot: for so much we had on
the bar of Capuri at low water. And doubting of King's
return, I sent John Douglas again in my long barge, as well
to relieve him, as also to make a perfect search in the bot-
tom of the bay; for it hath been held for infaffible, that
whatsoever ship or boat shall fall therein can never disem-
boque again, by reason of the violent current which setteth
into the said bay, as also for that the breeze and easterly
wind bloweth directly into the same. Of which opinion I
have heard John Hampton,⁸⁵ of Plymouth, one of the greatest
experience of England, and divers other besides that have
traded to Trinidad.

I sent with John Douglas an old carique of Trinidad for
a pilot, who told us that we could not return again by the
bay or gulf, but that he knew a by-branch which ran within
the land to the eastward, and he thought by it we might fall
into capuri, and so return in four days. John Douglas
searched those rivers, and found four goodly entrances,
whereof the least was as big as the Thames at Woolwich, but
in the bay thitherward it was shoal and but six foot water;
so as we were now without hope of any ship or bark to pass
over, and therefore resolved to go on with the boam, and the
bottom of the gakgo, in which we thrust 60 men. In the
Lion’s Whelp’s boat and wherry we carried twenty, Captain
Caulfield in his wherry carried ten more, and in my barge
other ten, which made up a hundred ; we had no other means
