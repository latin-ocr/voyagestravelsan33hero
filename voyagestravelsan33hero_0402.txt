394, DISCOVERY OF GUIANA

gladness; if not, he hath neither shot nor iron weapon in all
his empire, and therefore rnay easily be conquered.

And Ι further remember that Berreo confessed to me and
others, which I protest before the Maje-sty of God to be true,
that there was found among the prophecies in Peru, at such
time as the empire was reduced to the Spanish obedience, in
their chiefest temples, amongst divers others which fore-
shadowed the loss of the said empire, that from Inglatierra
those [ngas should be again in time to come restored, and
delivered from the servitude of the said conquerorS. And
I hope, as we with these few hands have displanted the first
garrison, and driven thern out of the said country, so her

and hold it as tributary, or conquer and keep it as empress
of the same. For whatsoever prince shall possess it, shall be
greatest; and if the king of Spain enjoy it, he will be-
come unresistible. Her Majesty hereby shall confirm and
strengthen the opinions of all nations as touching her great
and princely actions. And where the south border of Guiana
reacheth to the dominion and empire of the Ammaous, those
women shall hereby hear the name of a virgin, which is not
only able to defend her own territories and her neighbours‚
but also to invade and conquer so great empires and so far
removed.

I will judge those men worthy to be kings thereos, that by
her grace and leave will undertake it of themselves
