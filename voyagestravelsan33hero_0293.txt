TO NEWFOUNDLAND 285

Trending this coast, we came to the island called
Baccalaos, being not past two leagues from the main; to the
south thereof lieth Cape St. Francis, five leagues distant
from Baccalaos, between which goeth in a great bay, by the
vulgar sort called the Bay of C onception. Here we met with
the Swallow again, whom we had lost in the fog, and all
