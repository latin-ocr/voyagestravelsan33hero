SIR FRANCIS DRAKE REVIVED

calling upon this dull or effeminate Age, to follow his noble
steps for gold and silver.

S THERE is a general Vengeance which secretly pur-
Asueth the doers of wrong, and suffereth them not to
prosper, albeit no man of purpose empeach them: so
is there a particular Indignation, engraffed in the bosom of
all that are wronged, which ceaseth not seeking, by all means
possible, to redress or remedy the wrong received. Inso-
much as those great and mighty men, in whom their pros-
perous estate hath bred such an overweening of themselves,
that they do not only wrong their inferiors, but despise them
being injured, seem to take a very unfit course for their own
safety, and far unfitter for their rest. For as Esop teacheth,
even the fly hath her spleen‚ and the emmet [ant] is not
without her choler; and both together many times find
means whereby, though the eagle lays her eggs in JUPITER’S
lap, yet by one way or other, she escapeth not requital of her ““
wrong done [to] the emmet.

Among the manifold examples hereos, which former Ages
have committed to memory, or our Time yielded to sight:
I suppose, there hath not been any more notable then this
in hand; either in respect ot* the greatness of the person
by whom the first injury was offered, or the meanness of
him who righted himself. The one being, in his own con-
ceit‚ the mightiest Monarch of all the world! The other,
an English Captain, a mean subject of her Majesty’s! Who
(besides the wrongs received at Rio de [la] Hacha with
Captain JonN LOVELL in the years [15]65 and [15]66) hav-
ing been grievously endamaged at San Juan de Ulua in the
Bay of Mexico, with Captain JOHN HAmes, in the years
[15]67 and [15]68, not only in the loss of his goods of
