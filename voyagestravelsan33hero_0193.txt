THIRD VOYAGE 185

houses‚ with many storehouses large and strong for the
wares, which brought thither from Nombre de Dios, by the
river of Chagres, so to be transported by mules to Panama:
beside the Monastery‚ where we found above a thousand
bulls and pardons‚ newly sent from Rome.

In those houses we found three gentlewomen, which had
lately been delivered of children there, 'though their dwell-

comforted.

While the guards which we had, not without great need,

the town's end where we entered (they have no other en-
