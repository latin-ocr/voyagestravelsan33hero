138 SIR FRANCIS DRAKE

stays or buttresses, for the supporting of his greatness and
height, which being measured with a line close by the
bark and near to the ground, as it was indented or extant,
was found to be above thirty-nine yards about. The wood
of those trees is as heavy or heavier than Brazil or
Lignum vitoe; and is in colour white.

The next day after we had arrived (13th July), there
came also into that bay, an English bark of the Isle of
Wight, of Sir EDWARD HORSEY'S; wherein JAMEs Rmsz
was Captain and JOHN OVERY, Master, with thirty men:
of which, some had been with our Captain in the same
place, the year before. They brought in with them a
Spanish caravel of Seville, which he had taken the day be-
fore, athwart of that place; being a Caravel of Adviso
[Despatch boat] bound for Nombre de Dios; and also one
shallop with oars, which he had taken at Cape Blanc.
This Captain RANSE understanding our Captain's purpose,
was desirous to join in consort with him ; and was re-
ceived upon conditions agreed on between them.

Within seven days after his coming, having set up our
pinnaces, and despatched all our business, in providing all
things necessary, out of our ships into our pinnaces: we
departed (2oth July) from that harbonr, setting sail in the
morning towards Nombre de Dios, continuing our course
till we came to the Isles of Pinos: where, being within three
days arrived, we found (22nd July) two frigates of Nom-
bre de Dios lading plank and timber from thence.

The Negroes which were in those frigates, gave us some
particular understanding of the present state of the town;
and besides, told us that they had heard a report, that cer-
tain soldiers should come thither shortly, and were daily
looked for, from the Governor of Panama, and the country
thereabout, to defend the town against the Cimaroons (a
black people, which about eighty years past [i. e.‚ 1512]
fied from the Spaniards their masters, by reason of their
cruelty, and are since grown to a Nation, under two Kings
of their own: the one inhabiteth to the West, and the other
to the East of the Way from Nombre de Dios to Panama)
which had nearly surprised it [i. e., Nombre de Dios],
about six weeks before [i. e„ about Ioth June, 1572].
