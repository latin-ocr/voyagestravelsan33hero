GERMANY 97

For myself, I concur in opinion with such as suppose the
people of Germany never to have mingled by inter-mar-
riages with other nations, but to have remained a people
pure, and independent, and resembling none but themselves
Hence amongst such a mighty multitude of men, the same
make and form is found in all, eyes stern and blue‚ yellow
hair, huge bodies, but vigorous only in the first onset. Of
pains and labour they are not equally patient, nor can
they at all endure thrift and heat. To bear hunger and
cold they are hardened by their climate and soil.

Their lands, however somewhat different in aspect, yet
taken all together consist of gloomy forests or nasty
marshes; lower and moister towards the confines of Gaul,
more mountainous and windy towards Noricum and Pan-
nonia; very apt to bear grain, but altogether unkindly to
fruit trees; abounding in flocks and hemis, but generally
small of growth. Nor even in their oxen is found the
usual stateliness‚ no more than the natural ornaments and
grandem· of head. In the number of their herds they re-
joice; and these are their only, these their most desirable
riches. Silver and gold the Gods have denied them,
whether in mercy or in wrath‚ I am unable to determine.
Yet I would not venture to aver that in Germany no vein
of gold οι· silver is produced; for who has ever searched?
For the use and possession, it is certain they care not.
Amongst them indeed are to be seen vessels of silver, such
as have been presented to their Princes and Ambassadors,
but holden in no other esteem than vessels made of earth.
The Germans however adjoining to our frontiers value
gold and silver for the purposes of commerce, and are wont
to distinguish and prefer certain of our coins. They who
live more remote are more primitive and simple in their
dealings, and exchange one commodity for another. The
money which they like is the old and long known, that
indented‚² or that impressed with a chariot and two horses.
Silver too is what they seek more than gold, from no fond-
ness or preference, but because small pieces are more ready
in purehasing things cheap and common.

Neither in truth do they abound in iron, as from the
