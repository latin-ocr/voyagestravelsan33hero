fashion of their weapons may be gathered. Swords they
rarely use, or the larger spear. They carry javelins or,
in their own language, framm5‚ pointed with a piece of
iron short and narrow, but so sharp and manageaffle, that
with the same weapon they can fight at a distance or hand
to hand, just as need requires. Nay, the horsemen also are
content with a shield and a javehn, The foot throw like-
wise weapons missive, each particular is armed with many,
and hurls thern a mighty space, all naked or only wearing
a light cassock. In their equipment they show no ostenta-
tion; only that their shields are diversified and adorned with
curious colourS. With coats of mail very few are fur-
nished, and hardly upon any is seen a headpiece or helmet.
Their horses are nowise signal either in fashion or in fleet-

or turn them right about, with such compactness and equality
that no one is ever behind the rest. To one who considers
the whole it is manifest, that in their foot their principal
strength lies, and therefore they fight intermixed with the
horse: for such is their swiftness as to match and suit with
the motions and engagements of the cavalry. So that the
infantry are elected from amongst the most robust of their
youth, and placed in front of the army. The number to

and by this very name they continue to be called at home,
those of the hundred band.- thus what was at first no more
than a number, becomes thenceforth a title and distinction
of honour. In arraying their army, they divide the whole
into distinct battalions formed sharp in front. To recoil in
battle, provided you return again to the attack, passes with
them rather for policy than fear. Even when the combat
is no more than doubtful, they bear away the bodies of their
slain. The most glaring disgrace that can befall them,
is to have quitted their shield; nor to one branded with such
ignominy is it lawful to join in their sacrifices, or to enter
into their assemblies; and many who had escaped in the
day of battle, have hanged themselves to put an end to
this their infamy.

In the choice of kings they are determined by the splen-
