EGYPT 91

count of friendship for the people of Kyrene: however that
may be, he married, some say the daughter of Batt0s‚ others
of Arkesilaos, and others of Critobulos‚ a man of repute
among the citizens; and her name was Ladike. Now
wheneverAmasis lay with her he found himself unable to have
intercourse, but with his other wives he associated as he was
wont; and as this happened repeatedly, Amasis said to
his wife, whose name was Ladike: “ woman, thou hast given
me drugs, and thou shalt surely perish more miserably than
any other.” Then Ladik& when by her denials Amasis was
not at all appeased in his anger against her, made a vow in
her soul to Aphrodite, that if Amasis on that night had
intercourse with her (seeing that this was the remedy for
her danger), she would send an image to be dedicated to
her at Kyren& and after the vow immediately Amasis had
intercourse, and from thenceforth whenever Amasis came
in to her he had intercourse with her; and after this he
became very greatly attached to her. And Ladike paid the
vow that she had made to the goddess; for she had an image
made and sent it to Kyrene, and it was still preserved even
to my own time, standing with its face turned away from the
city of the Kyrenians. This Ladike Cambyses, having con-
quered Egypt and heard from her who she was, sent back
unharmed to Kyrene.

Amasis also dedicated offerings in Hellas, first at Kyrene
an image of Athene covered over with gold and a figure
of himself made like by painting; then in the temple of
Athene at Lindos two images of stone and a corslet of linen
worthy to be seen; and also at Samos two wooden figures of
himself dedicated to Hera, which were standing even to my
own time in the great temple, behind the doors. Now at
Samos he dedicated offerings because of the guest-friend-
ship between himself and Polycrates the son of Aiakes; at
Lindos for no guest-friendship but because the temple of
Athene at Lindos is said to have been founded by the
daughters of Danaos, who had touched land there at the
time when they were fleeing from the sons of Aigyptos.
These offerings were dedicated by Amasis; and he was the
first of men who conquered Cyprus and subdued it so that
it paid him tribute.
