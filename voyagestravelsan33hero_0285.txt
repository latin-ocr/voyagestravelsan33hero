ΤΟ NEWFOUNDLAND 2⁷7

Having buried, only in a preparation, a great mass of
substance, whereby his estate was impaired, his mind yet
not dismayed, he continued his former designment‚ and pur-
posed to revive this enterprise, good occasion serving. Upon
which determination standing long without means to satisfy
his desire, at last he granted certain assignments out of his
commission to sundry persons of mean ability, desiring the
privilege of his grant, to plant and fortify in the north parts
of America about the river of Canada; to whom if God gave
good success in the north parts (where then no matter of

action, greatly aiding him both by his advice and in the
charge. Other gentlemen to their ability joined unto him,
resolving to adventure their substance and lives in the same
cause. Who beginning their preparation from that time,
both of shipping, munition, victual, men, and things requisite,
some of them continued the charge two years complete with-
out intermission. Such were the difficulties and cross acci-
dents opposing these proceedings, which took not end in less
than two years; many of which circumstances I will omit.

The last place ot' our assembly, before we left the coast
of England, was in Cawset Bay, near unto Plymouth, then
