EGYPT 53

become all unfit for riding and driving, and the cause has
been these channels, which are many and run in all direc-
tions But the reason why the king cut up the land was this,
namely because those of the Egyptians who had their cities
not on the river but in the middle of the country, being in
want of water when the river went down from them, found
their drink brackish because they had it from wells. For this
reason Egypt was cut up: and they said that this king dis-
tributed the land to all the Egyptians, giving an equal square
portion to each man, and from this he made his revenue,
having appointed them to pay a certain rent every year: and
if the river should take away anything from any man's
portion, he would come to the king and declare that which
had happened, and the king used to send men to examine
and to find out by measurement how much less the piece of
land had become, in order that for the future the man might
pay less, in proportion to the rent appointed: and I think that
thus the art of geometry was found out and afterwards came
into Hellas also. For as touching the sun-dial and the ,
gnomon and the twelve divisions of the day, they were learnt
by the Hellenes from the Babylonians. He moreover alone
of all the Egyptian kings had rule over Ethiopia3 and he left
as memorials of himself in front of the temple of Hephaistos
two stone statues of thirty cubits each, representing himself
and his wife, and others of twenty cubits each representing
his four sons: and long afterwards the priest of Hephaistos
refused to permit Dareios the Persian to set up a statue of
himself in front of them, saying that deeds had not been
done by him equal to those which were done by Sesostris
the Egyptian; for Sesostris had subdued other nations be·-
sides, not fewer than he, and also the Scythians; but Dareios
had not been able to conquer the Scythians: wherefore it was
not just that he should set up a statue in front of those which
Sesostris had dedicated, if he did not surpass him in his
deeds. Which speech, they say, Dareios took in good part.

Now after Sesostris had brought his life to an end, his
son Pheros, they told me, received in succession the king-
dom, and he made no warlike expedition, and moreover
it chanced to him to become blind by reason of the follow-
ing accident z—when the river had come down in flood rising
