THIRD VOYAGE 135

nor came to anchor, nor made any stay for any cause,
neither there nor elsewhere, until twenty—five days after;
when (28th June) we had sight of the island of Guada-
loupe‚ one ot* the islands of the West Indies‚ goodly high
land.

The next morning (29th June), we entered between Dom-
inica and Guadaloupe, where we descried two canoes coming
from a rocky island, three leagues off Dominica; which
usually repair thither to fish, by reason of the great plenty
thereos, which is there continually to be found.

We landed on the south side os it, remaining there three
days to refresh our men; and to water our ships out of one
of those goodly rivers, which fall down off the mountain.
There we saw certain poor cottages; built with Palmito
boughs and branches; but no inhabitante, at that time, civil
or savage: the cottages it may be (for we could know no
certain cause of the solitariness we found there) serving, not
for continual inhabitation‚ but only for their uses, that came
to that place at certain seasons to fish.

The third day after (1st July), about three in the after-
noon, we set sail from thence, toward the continent of
Terra firma.

And the fifth day after (6th July)‚ we had sight of the high
land of Santa Marta; but carne not near the shore by ten
leagues.

But thence directed our course, for a place called by us,
Port Pheasant; for that our Captain had so named it in his
former voyage, by reason of the great store of those goodly
fowls, which he and his company did then daily kill and seed
on, in that place. In this course notwithstanding we had
two days calm, yet within six days after we arrived (12th
July) at Port Pheasant, which is a fine round bay, of very
safe harbour for all winds, lying between two high points,
not past half a cable's length over at the mouth, but within,
eight or ten cables’ length every way, having ten or twelve
fathoms of water more or less, full of good fish; the soil
also very fruitful, which may appear by this, that our
Captain having been in this place, within a year and few days
before [i. e., in July, 1571] and having rid the place with
many alleys and paths made; yet now all was so overgrown
