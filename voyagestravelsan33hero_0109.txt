GERMANY 101

by the State in the same sacred woods and groves, all milk-
white and employed in no earthly labour. These yoked in
the holy chariot, are accompanied by the Priest and the
Κίος, οι· the Chiet’ of the communsty, who both carefully
observed his actions and neighing. Nor in any sort of
augury is more saith and assurance reposed, not by the
populace only, but even by the nobles, even by the Priests.
These account themselves the ministers of the Gods, and
the horses privy to his will. They have likewise another
method of divination, whence to learn the issue of great
and mighty wars. From the nation with whom they are at

sumed through the slowness of the members in assembling.
They sit down as they list, promiscuously, like a crowd, and
all armed. It is by the Priests that silence is enjoined,
and with the power of correction the Priests are then in-
vested. Then the King or Chief is heard, as are others,
each according to his precedence in age, 01· in nobility‚ or
in warlike renown, or in eloquence; and the influence of
every speaker proceeds rather from his ability to persuade
than from any authority to command. If the proposition
