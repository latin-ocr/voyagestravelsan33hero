THIRD VOYAGE 159

march by land, to another river called Rio Guana, with
intent there to meet with another company of Cimaroons
which were now in the mountains.

So we departed that day from Rio Diego, with our pin-
nace8‚ towards our ship, as marvelling that she followed us
not as was appointed.

But two days after (16th September), we found her in the
place where we left her; but in far other state, being much
spoiled and in great danger, by reason of a tempest she had
in our absence.

As soon as we could trim our ship, being some two days,
our Captain sent away (18th September) one of his pin-
naces, towards the bottom of the bay, amongst the shoals

in of our ship nearer the Main.

The next day (19th September) we followed, and were
with wary pilotage, directed safely into the best channel,
with much ado to recover the road‚ among so many flats
and shoals. It was near about five leagues from the Cati-
vaas, betwixt an island and the Main, where we moored
our ship, The island was not above four cables in length
from the Main, being in quantity some three acres of
ground, flat and very full of trees and busheS.

We were forced to spend the best part of three days, after
our departure from our Port Plenty, before we were quiet

(22nd September), which we had but newly entered, when
our two men and the former troop of Cimaroons, with
twelve others whom they had met in the mountains, came
(23rd September) in sight over against our ship, on the
Main. Whence we fet[ched] them all aboard, to their great
comfort and our content: they rejoicing that they should
have some fit opportunity to wreak their wrongs on the
Spaniards3 we hoping that now our voyage should be
bettered.

At our first meeting, when our Captain had moved them,
to shew him the means which they had to furnish him with
gold and silver; they answered plainly, that “had they
known gold had been his desire; they would have satisfied
him with store, which, ior the present, they could not do:
