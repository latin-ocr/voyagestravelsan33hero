To THE READER

ECAUSE there have been divers opinions conceived of the
B gold ore brought from Guiana, and for that an alderman

of London and an officer of her Majesty's mint hath given
out that the same is of no price, I have thought good by the addi-
tion of these lines to give answer as well to the said malicious
slander as to other objections. It is true that while we abode
at the island of Trinidad Ι was informed by an Indian that not

mineral stones which they esteemed to be gold, and were there-

therein; but I was resolved that gold must be found either in
grains, separate from the stone, as it is in most of the rivers in
Gaiana, or else in a kind of hard stone, which we call the
