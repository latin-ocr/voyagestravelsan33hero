146 SIR FRANCIS DRAKE

though none slain but one Trumpeter: whereupon though
our surgeons were busily employed, in providing remedies
and salves for their wounds: yet the main care of our
Captain was respected by all the rest; so that before we
departed out of the harbour for the more comfort of our
company, we took the aforesaid ship of wines without great
