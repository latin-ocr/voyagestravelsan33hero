1:34 SIR FRANCIS DRAKE

some value, but also of his kinsmen and friends, and that
by the falsehood of DON MARTIN HENR19UEZ then the Vice-
roy of Mexico3 and finding that no reeompense could be
recovered out of Spain, by any of his own means, or by
Her Majesty's letters; he used such helps as he might, by
two several voyages into the West Indies (the first with
two ships, the one called the Dragon, the other the Swan,
in the year [15]70: the other in the Swan alone in the year
[15]71), to gain such intelligences as might further him,
to get some amends for his loss.

And having, in those two Voyages‚ gotten such certain
notice of the persons and places aimed at, as he thought
requisite, and thereupon with good deliberation resolved on
a Third Voyage (the description whereof we have now in
hand) 3 he accordingly prepared his ships and company, and
then taking the first opportunity of a good wind, had such
success in his proceedings, as now follows further to be
declared.

On XVhitsunday Eve, being the 24th of May, in the year
1572, Captain DRAKE in the Pascha of Plymouth of 70 tons,
his admiral [flag—shipL with the Swan of the same port, of
25 tons, his vice-admiral‚ in which his brother JOHN Diuum
was Captain (having in both of them, of men and boys
seventy-three, all voluntarily assembled3 of which the eldest
was fifty, all the rest under thirty: so divided that there were
forty-seven in the one ship, and twenty-six in the other.
Both richly surnished with victuals and apparel for a whole
year; and no less heedfully provided of all manner of muni-
tion, artillery, artificers, stuff and tools, that were requisite
sor such a Man-of-war in such an attempt: but especially
having three dainty pinnaces made in Plymouth, taken as-
under all in pieces, and stowed aboard, to be set up as
occasion served), set sail, from out of the Sound of Ply-
mouth, with intent to land at Nombre de Dios.

The wind continued prosperous and favourable at north-
east, and gave us a very good passage, without any alteration
or change: so that albeit we had sight (3rd June) of Porto
santo, one of the Madeiras, and of the Canaries also within
twelve days of our setting forth: yet we never struck sail,
