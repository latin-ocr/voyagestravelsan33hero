390 SIR WALTER RALEIGH

is so healthful, as of an hundred persons and more, which
lay without shift most sluttishly, and were every day almost
melted with heat in rowing and marching‚ and suddenly wet
again with great showers, and did eat of all sorts of corrupt
fruits, and made meals of fresh fish without seasoning, of
tortugas‚ of lagartos or crocodiles, and of all sorts good and
bad, without either order or measure, and besides lodged in
the open air every night, we lost not any one, nor had one

The navigation is short, for it may be sailed with an

and by the way neither lec-shore, enemies' coast, rocks, nor
sands. All which in the voyages to the West Indies and all
other places we are subject unto ; as the charmel of Bahama,
coming from the West IndieS, cannot well be passed in the
winter, and when it is at the best, it is a perilous and a feat-
ful place; the rest ot· the I ndies for calms and diseases very
troublesome, and the sea about the Bermudas a hellish sea
for thunder, lightning, and stormS.

This very year (1595) there were seventeen sail of
Spanish ships lost in the channel of Bahama, and the great
