344 SIR WALTER RALEIGH

sent to discover Manoa, to travel through his country, gave
them a guide for Macureguarai, the first town os civil and
apparelled people‚ from whence they had other guides to
bring them to Manoa, the great city of Inga‚· and being
furnished with those things which they had learned of
Campana were of most price in Guiana, went onward, and
in eleven days arrived at Manoa, as Berreo affirmeth for
certain; although I could not be assured thereos by the lord
which now governeth the province of Morequito, for he
told me that they got all the gold they had in other towns
on this side Manoa, there being many very great and rich,
and (as he said) built like the towns of Christians, with
many rooms.

When these ten Spaniards were returned, and ready
to put out of the border of Ammaia? the people of More-
quito set upon thern, and slew them all but one that swam
the river, and took from them to the value of 4o,ooo pesos
of gold; and one of them only lived to bring the news to
Berreo, that both his nine soldiers and holy father were
benighted in the said province. I myselt' spake with the
captains of M orequito that slew them, and was at the place
where it was executed. Berreo, enraged herewithal, sent
all the strength he could make into Aromaia, to be revenged
of him, his people‚ and country. But M orequito, suspecting
the same, fled over Ormoque, and thorough the territories
of the Saima and Wikiri recovered Czcmand, where he
thought himself very safe, with Vides the governor. But
Berreo sending for him in the king’s name, and his mes-
sengers finding him in the house os one Fajardo, on the
sudden, yere he was suspected, so as he could not then be
conveyed away, Vides durst not deny him, as well to avoid
the suspicion of the practice, as also for that an holy father
was slain by him and his people. Morequito offered
Fajardo the weight of three quintals in gold, to let him
escape; but the poor Guianian, betrayed on all sides, was
delivered to the camp-master of Berreo, and was presently
executed.

After the death of this Morequito, the soldiers of Berreo
spoiled his territory and took divers prisoners. Among

⁸1The district below the Caroni river.
