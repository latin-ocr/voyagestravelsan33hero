into heaps; which continually in greater quantity is in-
creased upon the sands by the flowing of the sea, and the
receiving heat of the sun kerning the same. So that of the
increase thereof they keep a continual traffic with their
neighbours.

Amongst other things we found here a kind of fruit
called cocos, which because it is not commonly known with
us in England, I thought good to make some description of
