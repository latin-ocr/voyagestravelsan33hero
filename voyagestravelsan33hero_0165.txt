THIRD VOYAGE 157

called by our Captain‚ Port Plenty; by reason we brought
in thither continually all manner store of good victuals,
which we took, going that way by sea, for the victualling
of Cartagena and Nombre de Dios as also the Fleets going
and coming out of Spain. So that if we had been two
thousand, yea three thousand persons, we might with our
pinnaces easily have provided them sufficient victuals of
wine, meal‚ rusk; cassavi (a kind of bread made of a root
called Yueca, whose juice is poison, but the substance good
and wholesome), dried bees, dried fish, live sheep, live
hogs, abundance of hens, besides the infinite store of dainty

is Spanish for H eadland] and our ships; which they named
Rio Diego.

These two being very sensible men, chosen out by their
commander [clzief], did, with all reverence and respect,
declare unto our Captain, that their nation conceited great
joy of his arrival, because they knew him to be an enemy
to the Spaniards, not only by his late being in Nombre
de Dios, but also by his former voyages3 and therefore were
