The Dedicatory Epistle, intended to
QUEEN ELIZABETH

Written by SIR F RANCIS DRAKE, Deceased.

To the Queen's most excellent Maj esty‚
my most dread Sovereigm

MADAM‚

SEEING divers have diversely reported and written of these
Voyages and Actions which I have attempted and made, every
one endeavouring to bring to light whatsoever inklings or con-
jectures they have had; whereby many untruths have been pub-
lished, and the certain truth concealed: as [so] I have thought
it necessary myself, as in a Card [chart] to prick the principal
points of the counsels taken, attempts made, and success had,
during the whole course of my employment in these services
against the Spaniard. Not as setting sail for maintaining my
reputation in men’s judgement, but only as sitting at helm, if occa-
sion shall be, for conducting the like actions hereafter. So I
have accounted it my duty, to present this Discourse to Your
Majesty‚ as of right; either for itself being the firstfruits of
your Servant's pen, or for the matter, being service done to Your ·
Majesty by your poor vassal, against your great Enemy: at times,
in such places, and after such sort as may seem strange to those
that are not acquainted with the whole carriage thereos ; but will
be a pleasing remembrance to Your Highness, who take the
apparent height of the Almighty’s favour towards you, by these
events, as truest instruments.
