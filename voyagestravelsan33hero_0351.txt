DISCOVERY OF GUIANA 343

so into Gaiana. But Berreo meant nothing less at that time3
for he wanted many provisions necessary for such an enter-
prise, and therefore departed from Margarita, seated himself
in Trinidad, and from thence sent his camp-master and his
sergeant-major back to the borders to discover the nearest
passage into the empire, as also to treat with the borderers,
and to draw them to his party and love; without which, he
knew he could neither pass safely, nor in any sort be relieved
with victual or aught else. Campana directed his company
to a king called M orequito, assuring them that no man could
deliver so much of Gaiana as M orequito could, and that his
dwelling was but five days' journey from Macureguarai, the
first civil town of Gaiana.

Now your lordship shall understand that this Morequito‚
one of the greatest lords or kings of the borders of Gaiana,

when Vides understood of Berreo and that he had made en-
trance into that territory, and foregone his desire and hope,
it was verily thought that Vides practised with M orequito to
hinder and disturb Berreo in all he could, and not to suffer
him to enter through his seignory, nor any of his companies ;
neither to victual‚ nor guide them in any sort. For Vides,
Governor of Cumana, and Berreo, were become mortal
enemies, as well for that Berreo had gotten Trinidad into his
patent with Gaiana, as also in that he was by Berreo pre-
vented in the journey of Guiana itself. Howsoever it was,
Ι know not, but Morequito for a time dissembled his dispo-
