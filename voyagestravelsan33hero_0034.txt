26 H ERODOTUS

who after their example abstain from sheep, say that this
custom was established ῑ.;’.’,ξ 3 thern for the cause which
follows z—Heracles (th-:y- say) had an earnest desire to see
Zeus, and Zeus did not desire to be seen of him; and at
last when Heracles was urgent in entreaty Zeus contrived
this device, that is to say, he flayed a ram and held in front
of him the head of the ram which he had cut off, and he
put on over him the fleece and then showed himself to him.
Hence the Egyptians make the image of Zeus with the
face of a ram3 and the Ammonians do so also after their
example, being settlers both from the Egyptians and from
the Ethiopians, and using a language which is a medley of
both tongues: and in my opinion it is from this god that
the Ammonians took the name which they have, for the
Egyptians call Zeus Amun. The Thebans then do not
sacrifice rams but hold them sacred for this reas0n; on
one day however in the year, on the feast of Zeus, they cut
up in the same manner and flay one single ram and cover
with its skin the image of Zeus, and then they bring up to
it another image of Heracles. This done, all who are in
the temple beat themselves in lamentation for the ram, and
then they bury it in a sacred tomb.

About Heracles Ι heard the account given that he was
of the number of the twelve gods; but of the other Heracles
whom the Hellenes know Ι was not able to hear in any part

not take the name of Heracles from the Hellenes, but rather
the Hellenes from the Egyptians,-that is to say those
of the Hellenes who gave the name Heracles to the son of
Amphitry0n‚-——of that, Ι say, besides many other evidences
there is chiefly this, namely that the parents of this Hera-
cles, Amphitryon and Alcmene, were both of Egypt by
descent, and also that the Egyptians say that they do not
know the names either of Poseidon or of the Dioscuroi‚
nor have these been accepted by them as gods among the
other gods3 whereas if they had received from the Hellenes
the name of any divinity, they would naturally have pre-
served the memory of these most of all, assuming that in
those times as now some of the Hellenes were wont to
make voyages and were seafaring folk, as Ι suppose and as
