DISCOVERY OF GUIANA 331

Spain with 600 soldiers and thirty horse. who, arriving on
the coast of Gaiana, was slain in a mutiny. with the most
part of such as favoured him, as also of the rebellious part,
insomuch as his ships perished and few or none returned;
neither was it certainly known what became of the said
Ordas until Berreo found the anchor of his ship in the river
of Orenoque; but it was supposed, and so it is written by
Lopez, that he perished on the seaS, and of other writers
diversely conceived and reported. And hereos it came that
Martinez entered so far within the land, and arrived at that
city of Inga the emperor; for it chanced that while Ordas

He lived seven months in Manoa, but was not suffered to
wander into the country anywhere. He was also brought
thither all the way blindsold, led by the Indiam, until he
came to the entrance of Manna itself, and was fourteen or
fifteen days in the passage. He avowed at his death that he
entered the city at noon, and then they uncovered his face;
