186 SIR FRANCIS DRAKE

this town some hour and half: we had not only refreshed
ourselves, but our company and Cimaroons had gotten
some good pillage‚ which our Captain allowed and gave
them (being not the thing he looked for) so that it were
not too cumbersome or heavy in respect of our travel, οι·

A little before we departed, some ten or twelve horse—
men came from Panama; by all likelihood, supposing that
we were gone out of this town, for that all was so still
