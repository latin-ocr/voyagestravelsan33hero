188 SIR FRANCIS DRAKE

Thereupon, the Master looked upon it, and saw written,
By me, FRANC1s DRAKE: wherefore he believed, and ac-
cording to the message, prepared what provision he could,
and repaired to the mouth of the river of Tortugos, as the
Cimaroons that went with him then named it.

That asternoon towards three a clock, we were come down
to that river, not past half-an-hour before we saw our pin-

leave off thus, but would once again attempt the same
Journey, whereof they also might be partakers.

Our Captain would not, in the meantime, suffer this edge

still idly unemployed‚ as knowing right well by continual
experience‚ that no sickness was more noisome to impeach
any enterprise than delay and idleness.

Therefore considering deeply the intelligences of other
places of importanee thereabouts, which he had gotten the
former years ; and particularly of Veragua, a rich town lying
to the Westward, between Nombre de Dios and Nicaragua,
where is the richest mine of fine gold that is on this North
