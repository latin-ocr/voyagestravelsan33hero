242 DRAKE'S FAMOUS VOYAGE

Now seeing the expectation of this attempt frustrated by
the causes aforesaid, we thought it meeter to fall with the
Isle Ferro, to see if we could find any better fortune3 and
coming to the island we landed a thousand men in a valley
under a high mountain, where we stayed some two or three
hours. In which time the inhabitants, accompanied with a
young fellow born in England, who dwelt there with them,
came unto us, shewing their state to be so poor that they
were all ready to starve, which was not untrue; and there-

for the ground was mountainous and full of dales, being a
very stony and troublesome passage; but such was his in-
dustrious disposition, as he would never leave, until we had ξ
gotten up to a fair plain, where we made stand for the as-
sembling of the army. And when we were all gathered
together upon the plain, some two miles from the town, the
Lieutenant-General thought good not to make attempt till
daylight, because there was not one that could serve for
guide or giving knowledge at all of the place. And there-
fore after having well tested, even half an hour before day,
he commanded the army to be divided into three special
