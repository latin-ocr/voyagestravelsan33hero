170 SIR. FRANCIS DRAKE

Within four or five days after, we came (27th November)
to our ship, where we found all other things in good order;
but received very heavy news of the death of JonN DRAKE,
our Captain’s brother, and another young man called
RICHARD ALLEN, which were both slain at one time (9th
October), as they attempted the boarding of a frigate, within
two days after our departing from thern.

The manner of it, as we learned by examination of the
company, was this. When they saw this {rigate at sea,
as they were going towards their sort with planks to make
the plafforrns, the company were very importunate on him,
to give chase and set upon this frigate, which they deemed
had been a fit booty for thern. But he told them, that they
“wanted weapons to assail; they knew not how the {rigate
was provided, they had their boats loaded with planks, to
finish that his brother had commanded.'’ But when this

words and supposals: “If you will needs,” said he, “ad-
venture! it shall never be said that I will be hindmost,
neither shall you report to my brother, that you lost your
voyage by any cowardice you found in me! '’

Thereupon every man shifted as they might for the time:
and heaving their planks overboard, took them such poor
weapons as they had: viz„ a broken pointed rapier, one old
visgee, and a rusty caliver: JonN DRAKE took the rapier, and
made a gauntlet of his pillow‚ R1CHARD ALLEN the visgee,
both standing at the head of the pinnace, called Eion.
ROBERT took the caliver and so boarded. But they found the
{rigate armed round about with a close fight of hides, full
of pikes and calivers, which were discharged in their faces,
and deadly wounded those that were in the sore-ship‚ JoHN
DRAKE in the belly, and RICHARD ALLi-:N in the head. But
notwithstanding their wounds, they with oars shifted off the
pinnace, got clear of the frigam, and with all haste recovered
their ship: where within an hour after, this young man of
great hope, ended his days, greatly lamented of all the
company.

Thus having moored our ships fast, our Captain resolved
to keep himself close without being descried, until he might
