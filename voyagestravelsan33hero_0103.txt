TACITUS ΟΝ GERMANY

from Gaul, from Rhoetia and Pannonia, by the

rivers Rhine and Danube; from Sarmatia and Dacia
by mutual sear, 01· by high mountains: the rest is encom-
passed by the ocean, which forms huge bays, and com-
prehends a tract of islands immense in extent: for we have
lately known certain nations and kingdoms there, such as
the war discovered. The Rhine rising in the Rhoetian Alps
from a summit altogether rocky and perpendicuhr, after
a small winding towards the west, is lost in the Northern
Ocean. The Danube issues out of the mountain Abnoba,
one very high but very easy of ascent, and traversing
several nations‚ falls by six streams into the Euxine Sea ;
for its seventh channel is absorbed in the Fenns.

The Germans, Ι am apt to believe, derive their original
from no other people; and are nowise mixed with different
nations arriving amongst them: since anciently those who
went in search of new dwellings, travelled not by land, but
were carried in fleets; and into that mighty ocean so bound-
less, and, as Ι may call it, so repugnant and forbidding ships
from our world rarely enter. Moreover, besides the dangers
from a sea tempestuous, horrid and unknown, who would
relinquish Asia, or Africa, or Italy, to repair to Germany,
a region hideous and rude, under a rigorous climate, dis-
mal to behold or to manure² unless the same were his native
country? In their old ballads (which amongst thern are the
only sort of registers and history) they celebrate Tuisto,
a God sprung from the earth, and Mannus his son, as the
fathers and founders of the nation. To Mannus they assign
three sons, after whose names so many people are called;
the Ingaevones, dwelling next the ocean; the Herminones,
