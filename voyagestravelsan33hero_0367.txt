DISCOVERY OF GUIANA 359

young and excellently favoured, which came among us with-
out deceit, stark naked. Nothing got us more love amongst
them than this usage3 for I suffered not any man to take
from any of the nations so much as a pina& or a potato root
without giving them contentment, nor any man so much as
to offer to touch any of their wives or daughters; which
course, so contrary to the Spaniards, who tyrannize over
them in all things, drew them to admire her Majesty‚ whose
commandment Ι told them it was, and also wonderfully to

a letter to the ships, which they promised to defiver, and
performed it; and then I went on, with my new hired pilot,
Martin the Arwacan. But the next or second day after, we
came aground again with our galley‚ and were like to cast
her away, with all our victual and provision, and so lay on
the sand one whole night, and were far more in despair at
this time to free her than before, because we had no tide of
flood to help us, and therefore feared that all our hopes
