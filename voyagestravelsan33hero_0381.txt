DISCOVERY OF GUIANA 373

thence, a man of great travel. And after he knew that Ι
had been in Gaiana, and so far directly west as Caroli, the
first question he asked me was, whether Ι had seen any of the
Ewaipanoma, which are those without heads. Who being es-
teemed a most honest man of his word, and in all things else,
told me that he had seen many οἱ them ; Ι may not name him,
because it may be for his disadvantage, but he is well known
to Monsieur Mouclzeron’s son of London, and to Peter Mou-
cheron, merchant, of the Flemish ship that was there in
trade; who also heard, what he avowed to be true, of those
people.

The fourth river to the west of Caroli is Casneroz which
falleth into the Orenoque on this side of Amapaia. And that
river is greater than Danubius, or any of Europe: it riseth
on the south of Guiana from the mountains which divide
Gaiana from Amazons, and Ι think it to be navigable many
hundred miles. But we had no time, means, nor season of
the year, to search those rivers, for the causes aforesaid,
the winter being come upon us; although the winter and
summer as touching cold and heat differ not, neither do the
trees ever sensibly lose their leaves, but have always fruit
either ripe or green, and most of them both blossoms‚ leaves,
ripe fruit, and green, at one time: but their winter only
consisteth of terrible rains, and overflowing of the rivers,
with many great storms and gusts, thunder and lightnings,
of which we had our fill ere we returned.

On the north side, the first river that falleth into the
Orenoque is Cari. Beyond it, on the same side is the river
of Limo. Between these two is a great nation of Cannibals,
and their chief town beareth the name of the river, and is
called Acamacari. At this town is a continual market of
women for three or four hatchets apiece; they are bought by
the Arwacas, and by them sold into the West [adies. To
the west of Limo is the river Pao, beyond it Caturi, beyond
that Voari, and C apuri‚⁴⁷ which falleth out of the great river
of Meta, by which Berreo descended from Nuevo Reyno de
Granada. To the westward of Capuri is the province of
Amapaia, where Berreo wintered and had so many of his
people poisoned with the tawny water of the marshes of the

⁴⁷ The Apure river.
