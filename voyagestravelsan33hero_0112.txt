104 TACITUS

Upon any recess from war, they do not much attend the
chase. Much more of their time they pass in indolence,
resigned to sleep and repasts.⁴ All the most brave, all
the most warlike, apply to nothing at all ; but to their wives,
to the ancient men, and to every the most impotent domestic,
trust all the care of their house, and of their lands and pos-
. sessions. They themselves loiter.⁵ Such is the amazing
diversity of their nature, that in the same men is found so
much delight in sloth, with so much enmity to tranquillity
and repose. The communities are wont, of their own
accord and man by man, to bestow upon their Princes 3
certain number of beasts, or 3 certain portion of grain;
a contribution which passes indeed for a mark of reverence
and honour, but serves also to supply their necessities.
They chiefly rejoice in the gifts which come from the
bordering countries‚ such as are sent not only by particulars
but in the name of the State; curious horses, splendid
armour, rich harness‚ with collars of silver and gold. Now

money.

That none of the several people in Germany live together
in cities, is abundantly known; nay, that amongst them
none of their dwellings are suffered to be contiguous. They
inhabit apart and distinct, just as a fountain‚ or a field, ,ςι-

villages in opposite rows, but not in our manner with the
houses joined one to another. Every man has a vacant
space quite round his own, whether for security against
accidents from fire, or that they want the art of building.
With them in truth, is unknown even the use of mortar
and of tiles. In all their structures they employ materials
quite gross and unhewn, void of fashion and comeliness.
Some parts they besmear with an earth so pure and re-
splendent, -that it resembles painting and colours. They
are likewise wont to scoop caves deep in the ground, and
over thern to lay great heaps of dung. Thither they retire
for shelter in the winter, and thither convey their grain:
for by such close places they mollify the rigorous and ex-
