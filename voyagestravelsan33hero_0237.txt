ROUND THE WORLD 229

to send us such victuals as were necessary for our provi-

sion. So that the same night we received of them meal, »-

which they call sagu, made of the tops of certain trees, tast-
ing in the mouth like sour curds, but melteth like sugat,
whereof they make certain cakes, which may be kept the
space of ten years, and yet then good to be eaten. We
had of them store of rice, hens, unperfect and liquid sugar,
sugar-canes, and a fruit which they call figo,²⁸ with store
of cloves.

The king having promised to come aboard, brake his
promise, but sent his brother to make his excuse, and to
entreat our General to come on shore, offering himself pawn
aboard for his safe return. Whereunto our General con-
sented not, upon mislike conceived of the breach of his
promise; the whole company also utterly refusing it. But
to satisfy him, our General sent certain of his gentlemen to
the Court, to accompany the king’s brother, reserving the
vice—king for their safe return. They were received of an-
other brother of the king's, and other states, and were con-

council. There were besides four grave persons, apparelled
all *in red, down to the ground, and attired on their heads
like the Turks; and these were said to be Romans ³⁹ and lig-
iers²⁰ there to keep continual traffic with the people of Ter-
nate. There were also two Turks ligiers in this place, and
one Italian. The king at last came in guarded with twelve
lances, covered over with a rich canopy with embossed gold.
Our men, accompanied with one of their captains called
Moro, rising to meet him, he graciously did welcome and
entertain them. He was attired after the manner of the
country, but more sumptuously than the rest. From his
waist down to the ground was all eloth of gold, and the same
very rich; his legs were bare, but on his feet were a pair of
shoeS‚ made of Cordovan skin. In the attire of his head
were finely wreathed hooped rings of gold, and about his
