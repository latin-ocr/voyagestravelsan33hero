INTRODUCTORY NOTE

SIR WALTER RALEIGH may be taken as the great typical figure
of the age of Elizabeth. Courtier and statesman‚ soldier and
sailor, scientist and man of letters, he engaged in almost all the
main lines of public activity in his time, and was distinguished
in them all.

His father was a Devonshire gentleman of property, connected
with many of the distinguished families of the south of England.
Walter was born about 1552 and was educated at Oxford. He
first saw military service in the Huguenot army in France in
1569, and in 1578 engaged, with his half-brother, Sir Humphrey
Gilbert, in the first of his expeditioris against the Spaniards.
After some service in Ireland, he attracted the attention of the
Queen, and rapidly rose to the perilous position of her chief
favorite. With her approval, he fitted out two expeditioris for
the colonization of Virginia, neither of which did his royal mis-
tress permit him to lead in person, and neither of which suc-
ceeded in establishing a permanent settlement.

After about six yeavrs of high favor, Raleigh found his posi-
tion at court endangered by the rivalry of Essex, and in 1592, on
returning from convoying a squadron he had fitted out against
thc Spanish, he was thrown into the Tower by the orders of the
Queen, who had discovered an intrzssgue between him and one of
her ladies whom he subsequently married. He was ultimately
released, engaged in various naval exploits, and in 1594 sailed for
South America on the voyage described in the following narrative.

On the death of Elisabeth, Raleigh’s missortunes increased.
He was accused of treason against James J, condemned, re-
prieved, and imprisoned for twelve years, during which he wrote
his “History of the World,” and engaged in scientisic researches.
In 1616 he was liberated, to make another attempt to find the
gold mine in Venezuela‚· but the expedition was disastrous, and,
on his return, Raleigh was executed on the old charge in 1618.
In his vices as in his virtues, Raleigh is a thorough representa-
tive of the great adventurers who laid the foundations of the
British Empire.
