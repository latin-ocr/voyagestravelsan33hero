thority of the Romans. From our arms, they rare1y rece1ve
any aid; from our money very frequently.

Nor less powerful are the several people beyond them;
namely, the Marsignians, the Gothinians‚ the Osians and the
Burians, who altogether enclose the Marcomanians and
Quadians behind. Of those, the Marsignians and the Burians
in speech and dress resemble the Suevians. From the Gallie
language spoken by the Gothinians, and from that of Pan-
nonia by the Osians, it is manifest that neither of these
people are Germans; as it is also from their bearing to pay
tribute. Upon them as upon aliens their tribute is imposed,
partly by the Sarmatiam, partly by the Quadians. The
'⁸ Gothinians‚ to heighten their disgrace, are forced to labour
in the iron mines. By all these several nations but little
level country is possessed: they are seated amongst forests,
and upon the ridges and declivities of mountains. For,
Suevia is parted by a continual ridge of mountains3 beyond
which, live many distinct nations. Of these the Lygians are
most numerous and extensive, and spread into several com-
munities. It will suffice to mention the most puissant3 even
the Arians, Helvicones, Manimians; Elysians and Naharval-
ians. Amongst the Naharvalians is shown a grove, sacred
to devotion extremely ancient. Over it a Priest presides
apparelled like a woman3 but according to the explication of
the Romans, ’tis Castor and Pollux who are here worshipped.
This Divinity is named Alcis. There are indeed no images
here, no traces of an extraneous superstition: yet their devo-
tion is addressed to young men and to brothers. Now the
Aryans‚ besides their forces, in which they surpass thev sev-
eral nations just recounted‚ are in their persons stern and
truculent; and even humour and improve their natural grim-
ness and ferocity by art and time. They wear black shields,
their bodies are painted black, they choose dark nights for
engaging in battle; and by the very awe and ghastly hue of
their army, strike the enemy with dread, as none can bear
this their aspect so surprising and as it were quite infernal.
For, in all battles the eyes are vanquished first.

Beyond the Lygians dwell the Gothones, under the rule of
a King; and thence held in subjection somewhat stricter than
the other German nations‚ yet not so strict as to extinguish
