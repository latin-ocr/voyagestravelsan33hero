EGYPT 55

And the priests told me, when I inquired, that the things
concerning Helen happened thus z-Alexander having car-
ried off Helen was sailing away from Sparta to his own
land, and when he had come to the Egean Sea contrary
winds drove him from his course to the Sea of Egypt; and
after that, since the blasts did not cease to blow, he came
to Egypt itself‚ and in Egypt to that which is now named
the Canobic mouth of the Nile and to Taricheiai. Now
there was upon the shore, as still there is now, a temple of
Heracles, in which if any man‘s slave take refuge and have

and after that he brought the man himself up to Memphis
and with him Helen and the wealth he had, and also in ad-
