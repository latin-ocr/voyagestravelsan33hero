152 SIR FRANCIS DRAKE

their bark was so deep?’' as making no great account of
it. But, by occasion of this demand, his brother sent one
down to the Steward‚ to know “Whether there were any
water in the ship? or what other cause might be?’'

The Steward, hastily stepping down at his usual scuttle,
was wet up to his waist‚ and shifting with more haste to
corne up again as if the water had followed him, cried out
that “The ship was full of water! ” There was no need
