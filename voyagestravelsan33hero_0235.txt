ROUND THE WORLD 227

of October we lighted upon divers others, some whereof
made a great show of inhabitants. We continued our course
by the islands of Tagulanda,¹⁵ Zelon, and Zewarra, being
friends to the Portugals, the first whereof hath growing in
it great store of cinnamon. The 14. of November we fell in
with the islands of Maluco. Which day at night (having
directed our course to run with Tidore) in coasting along
the island of Mutyr? belonging to the king of Ternate, his
deputy or vice-king seeing us at sea, came with his canoa
to us without all sear, and came aboard; and after some
conferenee with our General, willed him in any wise to run
in with Ternate, and not with Tidore, assuring him that the
king would be glad of his coming, and would be ready to
do what he would require, for which purpose he himself
would that night be with the king, and tell him the news.
With whom if he once dealt, we should find that as he was
a king, so his word should stand; adding further, that if he
went to Tidore before he came to Ternate, the king would
have nothing to do with us, because he held the Portugal
as his enemy. VVhereupon our General resolved to run with
Ternate. Where the next morning early we came to anchor ;
at which time our General sent a messenger to the king, with
a velvet cloak for a present and token of his coming to be
in peace, and that he required nothing but traffic and ex-
change of merchandise, whereof he had good store, in such
things as he wanted.

In the meantime the vice-king had been with the king
according to his promise, signifying unto him what good
things he might receive from us by traffie. Whereby the
king was moved with great liking towards us, and sent to
our General, with special message, that he should have what
things he needed and would require, with peace and friend-
ship; and moreover that he would yield himself and the
right of his island to be at the pleasure and commandment
of so famous a prince as we served. In token whereof he
sent to our General a signet; and within short time after
came in his own person, with boats and canoas, to our ship,
to bring her into a better and safer road than she was in at

²⁵Tagulandang, to the north-east of Celebes.
