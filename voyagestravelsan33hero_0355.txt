DISCOVERY OF GUIANA 347

he delivered that I could not enter any of the rivers with
any bark or pinnace, or hardly with any ship’s boat, it was
so low, sandy, and full of flats, and that his companies were
daily grounded in their canoes, which drew but twelve inches
water. He further said that none of the country would come
to speak with us, but would all fly; and if we followed them
to their dwellings, they would burn their own towns. And
besides that, the way was long, the winter at hand, and that
the rivers beginning once to swell, it was impossible to stem
the current; and that we could not in those small boats by
any means carry victuals for half the time, and that (which
indeed most discouraged my company) the kings and lords
of all the borders of Guiana had decreed that none of them
should trade with any Christians for gold, because the same
would be their own overthrow, and that for the love of
gold the Christians meant to conquer and dispossess them
of all together.

Many and the most of these Ι found to be true; but yet Ι
resolving to make trial of whatsoever happened, directed
Captain George Gifford, my Vice—Admiral‚ to take the Lion's
Whelp, and Captain Caulfield his bark‚ [and] to turn to the
eastward, against the mouth of a river called C apuri, whose
entrance I had before sent Captain leiddon and John Doug-
las the master to discover. Who found some nine foot
water or better upon the flood, and five at low water; to
whom Ι had given instructions that they should anchor at
the edge of the shoa1‚ and upon the best of the fiood to thrust
over, which shoal John Douglas buoyed and beekonedffl‘ for
them before. But they laboured in vain3 for neither could
they turn it up altogether so far to the east, neither did the
flood continue so long, but the water fell yere they could
have passed the sands. As we after found by a second ex-
perience: so as now we must either give over our enterprise,
or leaving our ships at adventure 400 mile behind us, must
run up in our ship’s boats, one barge‚ and two wherries.
But being doubtful how to carry victuals for so long a time
in such baubles‚ or any strength of men, especially for that
Berreo assured us that his son must be by that time come
down with many soldiers‚ I sent away one King, master of
