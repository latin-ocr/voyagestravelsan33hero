liberty, especially for that his eldest son was slain in a battle
on that side of the mountains, whom he most entirely loved)
that he remembered in his father’s lifetime, when he was
very old and himself a young man, that there came down
into that large valley of Gaiana a nation from so far off as
the sun slept (for such were his own words), with so great
