160 SIR FRANCIS DRAKE

because the rivers, in which they sunk great store (which
they had taken from the Spaniards, rather to despite them
than for love of gold) were now so high, that they could
not get it out of such depths for him; and because the
Spaniards, in these rainy months, do not use [are not accus-
tomed] to carry their treasure by land.’'

This answer although it were somewhat unlooked for; yet
nothing discontented us, but rather persuaded us farther of
their honest and faithful meaning toward us. Therefore our
Captain to entertain these five months, commanded all our
ordnance and artillery ashore, with all our other provisions:
sending his pinnaces to the Main, to bring over great trees,

ordnance. Thus our Captain and his brother took their
1eave; the one to the Eastward, and the other to the
Cativaas,

That night, we carne to an isle, which he called Spur-kite
land, because we found there great store of such a kind of
bird in shape, but very delicate, of which we killed and
roasted many; staying there till the next day midnoon (8th
October), when we departed thence. And about four,
