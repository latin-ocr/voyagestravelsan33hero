122 TACITUS

for arms, this is the safeguard of all, and by this every wor-
shipper of the Goddess is secured even amidst his foes.
Rare amongst thern is the use of weapons of iron, but fre·
quent that of clubs. In producing of grain and the other
fruits of the earth, they labour with more assiduity and
patience than is suitable to the usual laziness of Germans.
Nay, they even search the deep, and of all the rest are
the only people who gather amber. They call it glasing,
and find it amongst the shallows and upon the very shore.
But, according to the ordinary incuriosity and ignorance of
Barbarians, they have neither learnt, nor do they inquire,
what is its nature, or from what cause it is produced. In
truth it lay long neglected amongst the other gross dis-
charges οἱ the sea3 till from our luxury, it gained a name
and value. To themselves it is of no use: they gather it
rough, they expose it in pieces coarse and unpolished‚ and
for it receive a price with wonder. You would however
conceive it to be a liquor issuing from trees, for that in the

application of fire, it kindles like a torch; and feeds a thick
and unctuous flame very high scented, and presently be-
comes glutinous like pitch or rosin.

Upon the Suiones, border the people Sitones; and, agree·
ing with them in all other things, differ from thern in one,
that here the sovereignty is exercised by a woman. So
'notoriously do they degenerate not only from a state of
liberty, but even below a state of bondage. Here end the
territories of the Suevians.

Whether amongst the Sarmatians or the Germans I ought
to account the Peucinians, the Venedians, and the Fennians,
is what I cannot determine; though the Peucinians, whom
some call Basstarnians, speak the same language with the
