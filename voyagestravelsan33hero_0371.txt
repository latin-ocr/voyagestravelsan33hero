DISCOVERY OF GUIANA 36³

river which came from the north, called Europa, and fell
into the great river; and beyond it on the same side We an-
chored for that night by another island, six miles long and
two miles broad, which they call Ocaywita. From hence, in
the morning, we lauded two Guianians, which we found in
the town of Toparimaca, that came with us; who went to give
notice of our coming to the lord of that country, called
Putyma‚ a follower of Topiawari‚ chief lord of Ammaia,
who succeeded M orequito, whom (as you have heard before)
Berreo put to death. But his town being far within the
land, he came not unto us that day; so as we anchored again
that night near the banks of another land, of bigness much
like the other, which they call Putapayma, over against which
island, on the main land, was a very high mountain called
Oecope. We coveted to anchor rather by these islands in
the river than by the main, because of the tortugas’ eggs,
which our people found on them in great abundance; and
also because the ground served better for us to cast our nets
for fish, the main banks being for the most part stony and
high and the rocks of a blue, metalline colour‚ like unto the
best steel ore, which I assuredly take it to be. Of the same
blue stone are also divers great mountains Which border this
river in many places.

The next morning, towards nine of the clock, we weighed
anchor; and the breeze increasing, we sailed always west up
the river, and, after a while, opening the land on the right
side, the country appeared to be champaign and the banks
shewed very perfect red. I therefore sent two of the little
barges with Captain Gifford, and with him Captain Thyn,
Captain CaulfieZa', my cousin Greenvihe, my nephew John
Gilbert, captain Eynos, Master Edward Porter, and my
cousin Butshead Gorges‚ with some few soldiers, to march
over the banks of that red land and to discover what manner
of country it was on the other side; who at their return found
it all a plain level as far as they went or could discern from
the highest tree they could get upon. And my old pilot, a
man of great travel, brother to the cacique Toparimaca, told
me that those were called the plains of the Sayma, and that
the same level reached to Cumand and Caracas, in the W est
Indies, which are a hundred and twenty leagues to the north,
