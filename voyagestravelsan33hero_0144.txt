138 SIR FRANCIS DRAKE

again, as that we doubted, at first, whether this was the
same place or not.

At our entrance into this bay, our Captain having given
order to his brother what to do, if any occasion should hap-
pen in his absence, was on his way, with intent to have gone
aland with some few only in his company, because he knew

departure, in a very great tree‚ not far from this which had
the lead nailed on it, which had continued burning at least
five days before our arrival.
