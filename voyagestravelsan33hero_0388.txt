380 SIR WALTER RALEIGH

and in a multitude of other rivers, they gathered it in grains
of perfect gold and in pieces as big as small stones, and
they put it to a part of copper, otherwise they could not
work it; and that they used 3 great earthen pot with holes
round about it, and when they had mingled the gold and
copper together they fastened canes to the holes, and so

speak of.

Having learned what I could in Canuri and Aromaia,
and received a faithful promise of the principallest of those
provinces to become servants to her Majesty‚ and to resist
, the Spaniards if they made any attempt in our absence,
and that they would draw in the nations about the lake of
Cossipa and those of Iwarawaqueri, Ι then parted from old
