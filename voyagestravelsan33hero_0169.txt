THIRD VOYAGE 151

o’clock recovered a big island in our way, where we stayed
all night, by reason that there was great store of fish, and
especially of a great kind of shell-fish of a foot long. We
called thern Whelks.

The next morning (9th October), we were clear of these
islands and shoals, and hauled off into the sea. About four
days after (13th October), near the island of St. Bernards‚
we chased two frigates ashore; and recovering one of these
islands, made our abode there some two days (14th-15th
October) to wash our pinnaces and to take of the fish. ’

Thence we went towards Tolou‚ and that day (16th Octo-
ber) landed near the town in a garden, where we found
certain Indians, who delivered us their bows and arrows,
and gathered for us such fruit as the garden did yield, being
many sorts of dainty fruits and roots, [we] still contenting
them for what we received. Our Captain’s principal intent
in taking this and other places by the way, not being for

state of the country and of the Fleets.

Hence we departed presently, and rowed towards
Charesha, the island of Cartagena; and entered in at Bocha
Chica, and having the wind large, we sailed in towards the
city, and let fall our grappers [grappling irons] betwixt
the island and the Main, right over against the goodly
Garden Island. In which, our Captain would not suffer us
to land, notwithstanding our importunate desire, because he
knew, it might be dangerous: for that they are wont to send
soldiers thither, when they know of any Men-of-war on the
coast; which we found accordingly. For within three hours
after, passing by the point of the island, we had a volley of
a hundred shot from them, and yet there was but one of our
men hurt.

This evening (16th October) we departed to sea ; and
the day following (17th October), being some two leagues
off the harbour, we took a bark, and found that the captain
and his wife with the better sort of the passengers, had
forsaken her, and were gone ashore in the Gundeloe [ship’s
boat]: by occasion whereof we boarded without resistance,
though they were well provided with swords and targets
and some small shot, besides four iron bases. She was 50
