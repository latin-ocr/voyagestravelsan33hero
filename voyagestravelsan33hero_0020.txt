12 HERODOTUS

seus to the fish-curing houses of Pelusion, a distance of forty
schoines, and counting it to extend inland as far as the city
of Kercasoros, where the Nile divides and runs to Pelusion
and Canobos, while as for the rest of Egypt, they assign it
partly to Libya and partly to Arabia,—-if‚ I say, we should
follow this account, we should thereby declare that in for-
mer times the Egyptians had no land to live in; for, as we
have seen, their Delta at any rate is alluvial, and has ap-
peared (so to speak) lately‚ as the Egyptians themselves say
and as my opinion is. If then at the first t‘here was no land
for them to live in, why did they waste their labour to prove
that they had come into being before all other men? They
needed not to have made trial of the children to see what
language they would first utter. However I arn not of
opinion that the Egyptians came into being at the same
time as that which is called by the Ionians the Delta, but
that they existed always ever since the human race came
into being, and that as their land advanced forwards, many
of them were left in their first abodes and many came down
gradually to the lower parts. At least it is certain that in
old times Thebes had the name of Egypt, and of this the
circumference measures six thousand one hundred and
twenty furlongs.

If then we judge aright of these matters, the opinion of
the Ionians about Egypt is not sound: but if the judgment
of the Ionians is right, Ι declare that neither the Hellenes
nor the Ionians themselves know how to reckon since they
say that the whole earth is made up οἱ three divisions,
Europe, Asia, and Libya: for they ought to count in addi-
tion to these the Delta of Egypt, since it belongs neither to
Asia nor to Libya; for at least it cannot be the river Nile
by this reckoning which divides Asia from Libya, but the
Nile is eleft at the point of this Delta so as to flow round
it, and the result is that this land would come between Asia
and Libya.

We dismiss then the opinion of the Ionians, and express
a judgment of our own on this matter also, that Egypt is
all that land which is inhabited by Egyptians, just as Kilikia
is that which is inhabited by Kilikians and Assyria that
which is inhabited by Assyrians, and we know of no boun-
