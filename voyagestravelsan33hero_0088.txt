30 HERODOTUS

down to my time the sheds where their ships were drawn up
and the ruins of their houses.

Thus then Psammetichos obtained Egypt: and of the
Oracle which is in Egypt I have made mention often before
this, and now I will give an account of it, seeing that it is
worthy to be described. This Oracle which is in Egypt is
sacred to Leto, and it is established in a great city near that
mouth of the Nile which is called Sebennytic, as one sails
up the river from the sea3 and the name of this city where
the Oracle is found is Buto, as I have said before in men·
tioning it. In this Buto there is a temple of Apollo and
Artemis; and the temple-house of Leto, in which the Oracle
is, is both great in itself and has a gateway of the height of
ten fathoms: but that which caused me most to marvel of the
things to be seen there, I will now tell. There is in this
sacred enclosure a house of Leto made of one single stone
as regards both height and length, and of which all the walls
are in these two directions equal, each being forty cubits;
and for the covering in of the roos there lies another stone
upon the top, the cornice measuring four cubits. This house

temple is the most marvellom, and among those which corne

several altars are set up within, and there are planted in the
island many palm-trees and other trees, both bearing fruit
and not bearing fruit. And the Egyptians, when they say
that it is floating, add this story, namely that in this island,
which formerly was not floating, Leto, being one of the
eight gods who came into existence first, and dwelling in
the city of Buto where she has this Oracle, received Apollo
from Isis as a charge and preserved him, concealing him
in the island which is said now to be a floating island, at that
time when Typhon came after him secking everywhere and

. desiring to find the son ot' Osiris. Now they say that Apollo
