DISCOVERY OF GUIANA 383

a mighty river which toucheth no part of the side of the
mountain, but rusheth over the top of it, and falleth to the
ground with so terrible a noise and clamour, as if a thousand
great bells were knocked one against another. Ι think there
is not in the world so strange an overfall, nor so wonderful
to behold. Berreo told me that there were diamonds and
other precious stones on it, and that they shined very far
off; but what it hath I know not, neither durst he or any of
