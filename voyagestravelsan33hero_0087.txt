EGYPT 79

Ionians and Carians who ha'd sailed forth for plunder were
compelled to come to shore in Egypt, and they having landed
and being clad in bronze armour, one of the Egyptians, not
having before seen men clad in bronze armour, came to the
fen-land and brought a report to Psammetichos that bronze
men had come from the sea and were plundering the plain.
So he, pereeiving that the saying of the Oracle was coming
to pass, dealt in a friendly manner with the Ionians and
Cariam, and with large promises he persuaded them to take
his part. Then when he had persuaded them, with the help
of those Egyptians who favoured his cause and of these
foreign mercenaries he overthrew the kings. Having thus
got power over all Egypt, Psammetichos made for He-
phaistos that gateway of the temple at Memphis which is
turned towards the South Wind; and he built a court for
Apis, in which Apis is kept when he appears opposite to
the gateway of the temple, surrounded all with pillars and
covered with figures; and instead of columns there stand to
support the roof of the court colossal statues twelve cubits
high. Now Apis is in the tongue of the Hellenes Epaphos.
To the Ionians and to the Carians who had helped him
Psammetichos granted portioris of land to dwell in, opposite
÷ to one another with the river Nile between, and these were
¹ called “Encampments”; these portions of land he gave
' thern, and he paid them besides all that he had promised:
moreover he placed with them Egyptian boys to have them
“ taught the Hellenic tongue; and from these, who learnt the
language thoroughly, are descended the present class of in-
* terpreters in Egypt. Now the Ionians and Carians occupied

these portioris of land for a long time, and they are towards
the sea a little below the city of Bubastis, on that which
is called the Pelusian mouth of the N ile. These men king
Amasis afterwards removed from thence and established
them at Memphis, making them into a guard for himself
against the Egyptians: and they being settled in Egypt, we
who are Hellenos know by intercourse with them the cer-
tainty of all that which happened in Egypt beginning from
king Psammetichos and afterwards; for these were the first
men of foreign tongue who settled in Egypt: and in the
land from which they were removed there still remained
