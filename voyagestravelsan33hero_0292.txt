284 GILBERT’S VOYAGE

Before we come to Newfoundland, about 50 leagues on
this side, we pass the bank, which are high grounds rising
within the sea and under water, yet deep enough and with-
out danger, being commonly not less than 25 and 30 fathom
water upon them; the same, as it were some vein of moun-
tains within the sea, do run along and from the N ewfound-
land, beginning northward about 52 or 53 degrees of latitude,
and do extend into the south infinitely. The breadth of this
bank is somewhere more, and somewhere 1ess; but we found
the same about ten leagues over, having sounded both on
this side thereos, and the other toward N ewfoundland, but
found no ground with almost 200 fathom of line, both before
and after we had passed the bank. The Portugals, and
French chiefly, have a notable trade of fishing upon this
bank, where are sometimes an hundred or more sails of ships,
who commonly begin the fishing in April, and have ended
by July‚ That fish is large, always wet, having no land near
to dry, and is called cod fish. During the time of fishing‚
a man shall know without sounding when he is upon the bank,
by the incredible multitude of sea-fowl hovering over the
same, to prey upon the offals and garbage of fish thrown
out by fishermen, and floating upon the sea.

Upon Tuesday, the 11. of June we forsook the coast of
England. So again [on] Tuesday, the 30. of July‚ seven
weeks after, we got sight of land, being immediately embayed
in the Grand Bay, or some other great bay; the certainty
whereof we could not judge, so great haze and sog did hang
upon the coast, as neither we might discern the land well,
nor take the sun’s height. But by our best computation we
were then in the 51 degrees of latitude. Forsaking this bay
and uncomfortable coast (nothing appearing unto us but
hideous rocks and mountains, bare of trees, and void of any
green herb) we followed the coast to the south, with weather
fair and clear. We had sight of an island named Penguin,
of a fowl there breeding in abundance almost incredible‚
which cannot fly, their wings not able to carry their body,
being very large (not much less than a goose) and exceeding
fat, which the Frenchmen use to take without difficulty
upon that island, and to barrel them up with salt. But for
lingering of time, we had made us there the like provision.
